		<h1>Catan Expansions</h1> 
			<p>This is a collection of expansions to the game of Catan. All rules of the base game apply with the following new rules:</p>

		<h3>Gold</h3>
			<p>Gold hexes are added to the board and operate much the same as they do in the Explorers and Pirates Expansion:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Gold hexes produce one gold each time their resource number is rolled during a production round</li>
				<li>2 gold may be traded to the bank for any 1 resource</li>
				<li>Gold may be traded with other players</li>
			</ul>

		<h3>The Dragon</h3>
			<p>For every 7 gold that is produced by gold hexes, the dragon attacks the player with the most victory points. This attack occurs immediately after resource production roll. The victim of the dragon attack must assign a number to each of his settlements / cities and knights and roll a die to determine which one is attacked. A settlement attacked by the dragon is destroyed and removed from the board. If more than once player is tied for most victory points, include gold in the count.</p>

		<h3>Ships</h3>
			<p>Players who build a settlement or city on the coast may build <b>[1 ship per turn or as many ships as they can afford?]</b>. Newly built ships are placed on any sea hex adjacent to the player's coastal settlements.</p>
			<p>A ship costs 1 wood and 1 wool</p>
			<p>On a players turn, each ship may perform <b>[one action or many?]</b>. A ship may not take any action on the same turn it is built. Ship actions include the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Movement</b> Ships can sail one to <b>[four?]</b> sea hexes per movement. (multiple ships may occupy the same sea hex and ships may sail through sea hexes occupied by another player's ship)</li>
				<li><b>Attack</b> Ships can attack another player's ships or coastal settlements if they both occupy the same sea hex. Both players involved roll one die and the higher die wins the battle. A tie must be re-rolled. The results of an attack may be one of the following:
					<ul>
						<li>victor may plunder two gold from the loser. If the loser does not have any gold, he may rob one resource from the losers hand at random.</li>
						<li>if attack is on a ship, the loser must retreat and move his ship back to one of his coastal settlements, or nearest unoccupied sea hex</li>
						<li>victor destroys loser's settlement/ship and removes it from the board</li>
						<li>victor occupies loser's settlement/ship, removes it from the board and replaces it with his own</li>
						<li>If the defender wins no action is taken</li>
						<li>If the defender wins the attacker must retreat and move his ship to the nearest unoccupied sea hex</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p><b>Ship benefits:</b> Players who have built ships also may:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Defend</b> When attacking with a ship, if the sea hex is occupied by an opponent's ship, the attacker must first attack the ship before attacking any coastal settlements</li>
				<li><b>Use port trades</b> Players may use any trade benefits of ports that their ship is adjacent to.</li>
				<li><b>Build</b> Players may build a new settlement (or knight if playing with knight module) on any coastal hex that is adjacent to one of their ships (respecting distance rule)</li>
				<li><b>Resource production</b> Players may collect one resource per ship if the number for a production roll matches a resource hex adjacent to any of their ships</li>
				<li><b>Largest Navy</b> The first player to build 3 ships receives the Largest Navy card that is worth 2 victory points. Like Largest Army, this may be stolen if another player builds a larger Navy.</li>
			</ul>

		<h3>The Kraken</h3>
			<p>For every 7 sea hexes that ships sail across, the kraken attacks the player with the most victory points. This attack occurs immediately after ship movement. The victim must assign a number to each of his ships and coastal settlements and roll to determine which one is destroyed. Coastal cities are downgraded to settlements. If the victim does not have any ships or coastal settlements, the victim becomes the player with the second most victory points, etc.</p>

		<h3>Knights</h3>
			<p>Before the game begins, remove all knight cards from the dev card deck. During the trade and build phase of a player's turn, he may build <b>[1 knight or many]?</b> Newly built knights are placed on any hex adjacent to the player's settlements.</p>
			<p>Building a knight costs 1 ore and 1 wool.</p>
			<p>On a players turn, each knight may perform <b>[one action or many?] [A knight may not take any action on the same turn it is built?]</b> Knight actions include the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Movement</b> Knights can move <b>[1 hex or 3]?</b> across unsettled territory, or <b>[two hexes or 4]?</b> that are adjacent to roads, per movement. (multiple knights may occupy the same hex and knights may move through hexes occupied by another player's knights)</li>
				<li><b>Attack</b> Knights can attack another player's Knights or settlements if they both occupy the same sea hex. Both players involved roll one die and the higher die wins the battle. A tie must be re-rolled. The results of an attack may be one of the following:
					<ul>
						<li>victor may plunder two gold from the loser. If the loser does not have any gold, he may rob one resource from the losers hand at random.</li>
						<li>if attack is on another knight, the loser must retreat and move his knight back to one of his settlements, or nearest unoccupied hex</li>
						<li>victor destroys loser's settlement/knight and removes it from the board</li>
						<li>victor occupies loser's settlement, removes it from the board and replaces it with his own</li>
						<li>If the defender wins no action is taken</li>
						<li>If the defender wins the attacker must retreat and move his knight to the nearest unoccupied hex (distance rule - two spaces away?)</li>
					</ul>
				</li>

			</ul>
			<p><b>Knight benefits:</b> Players who have built knights also may:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Defend</b> When attacking with a knight, if the hex is occupied by an opponent's knight, the attacker must first attack the knight before attacking any settlements</li>	
				<li><b>Use port trades</b> Players may use any trade benefits of ports that their knight is adjacent to.</li>
				<li><b>Build</b> Players may build a new settlement (or ship if playing with ship module) on any hex that is occupied by one of their knights (respecting distance rule)</li>
				<li><b>Resource production</b> Players may collect one resource per knight if the number for a production roll matches a resource hex occupied by any of their knights</li>
				<li><b>Largest Army</b> This rule applies the same as base Catan. The first player to build 3 knights get Largest Army which is worth 2 victory points. Another player may steal if he builds a larger army.</p>

		<h3>Game Phases</h3>
			<p>If you play with knights and ships and elect to grant them destructive powers, this can greatly lengthen the game. To remedy this, and also to keep the game to a reasonable length, you may elect to play the game with three phases:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Phase 1 - Build:</b>	During this phase, players may only build roads, settlements and cities. No knights or ships may be built.</li>
				<li><b>Phase 2 - Cold War:</b>	During this phase, players may begin building ships and knights, however no attack actions are allowed.</li>
				<li><b>Phase 3 - Attack:</b> During this phase attack actions are allowed</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Each phase lasts three rounds of turns. Implement a counter to keep track. At the end of the 9th round, the player with the most victory points wins</p>
