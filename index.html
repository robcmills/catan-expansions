			<span class="toggler">+</span> Objective
		</h3>
			<div class="objective section">
				<p>The objective of the game is to be the player with the most victory tokens at the end of the game. Victory tokens are claimed in the following ways:</p>
				<p><b>Anytime - Multiple possible</b></p>
				<ol>
					<li><b>Battle:</b> For each Combat Unit that you defeat in battle collect a number of victory tokens equal to its value.</li>
					<li><b>Conquer:</b> For each Building that you sieze from another player collect a number of victory tokens equal to its value.</li>
					<li><b>Rescue:</b> For each prisoner that you free collect a number of victory tokens equal to its value.</li>
				</ol>

				<p><b>Once at the end (if a tie exists both players receive tokens) (counted as total combined values)</b></p>
					<ol>
						<li><b>General:</b> 3 tokens for the player with the most prisoners.</li>
						<li><b>Admiral:</b> 3 tokens for the player with the most sunken ships.</li>

					<li><b>Build the Map:</b><br>
						The size and geography of the map have a great effect on the game experience. Players are encouraged to be creative, and build the map however they like. However the following are some guidelines that help ensure an even distribution and balanced layout, as well as some recommended examples for new players.<br>
						<b>Size:</b><br>
						2 players - 6 hex edges<br>
						3 players - 7 hex edges<br>
						4 players - 8 hex edges<br>

						3 player map example:

						</div>
					</li>

					<li><b>Starting Units:</b> Each player begins the game with the following units:<br>
						3 soldiers, 2 archers, 1 cavalry<br>
						3 caravels, 2 freighters, 1 galleon<br>
						3 villages, 2 towns, 1 castle<br>
						6 walls<br>
						1 artillery<br>
					</li>

					<li><b>Prevailing Winds:</b> Determine the direction of prevailing by flipping the Prevailing Winds Token. Place it in the center of the map.</li>

					<li>You are now ready to begin the game.</li>

			<div class="phases section">
				<p>The game consists of 2 phases.</p>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Phase 1 - Build:</b><br>
					Divide the map equally among all players. Diagram<br>
					All players simultaneously place all their starting units in their portion of the map.<br>
					A placed unit may be re-placed at any time until the end of the phase (as a reaction to opponent placement) however a unit may only be re-placed up to 3 times.
					</li>
					<li><b>Phase 2 - Battle:</b><br>
					Turn order is sequential in the opposite direction of Prevailing Winds.
					Players may Recruit combat units and Activate units in any order.<br>
					Players may not build additional villages, towns, castles nor walls. See <a href="#artillery">Artillery</a> section for special rules<br>

			<div class="winds section">
				<p>The sea beyond the border of the map is the deep, open ocean, where strong, prevailing winds can greatly enhance a sea-worthy sailor's ability to travel long distances.<br>
				When ships move out into the deep sea, they may take advantage of the prevailing winds to travel from one edge of the map to the next adjacent edge in addition to each ship's normal movement range. Though they must travel in the same direction as the prevailing winds, which are either clockwise or counter-clockwise around the map.<br>
				Player's ships may enter the prevailing winds from any border sea hex, and exit into any border sea hex on the next edge of the map.</p>
				<div class="diagram">
					<p>In this example, the caravel is able to move into the prevailing winds and sail around the penninsula because the winds are clockwise and it has a movement range of 6.</p>
					<img src='img/diagram-winds-caravel.png' />
				</div>
				<p>
				Ships may not end their movement in the deep ocean. Ships must use 1 movement to enter prevailing winds and 1 movement to exit. If a ship does not have 2 spare movements it may not use prevailing winds.</p>
				<div class="diagram">
					<p>The galleon here is too far away from the edge of the map to make use of prevailing winds because it only has a movement range of 4.</p>

						Units can attack opponents in the same or adjacent hexes.<br>
						To resolve close combat attacks, both players involved roll a number of dice equal to the value of the unit participating in the battle. Compare only each player's highest die, and the greater value wins the battle. Ties must be re-rolled.
						</li>
						<li><b>Ranged:</b><br>
						Archers, Artillery and Galleons are capable of ranged attacks.<br>
						Ranged attacks can only extend in straight lines perpendicular to the center of each hex edge.<br>
						<div class="diagram">

						<div class="diagram">

						</div>
						To resolve a ranged attack, the attacker rolls a number of dice equal to the value of the unit. If any die result is 1, 2 or 3 the attack is successful.<br>
						Ranged attack accuracy decreases with range. For attacks at range 2, only a die roll of 1 or 2 scores a hit. At range 3, only a 1 scores a hit.

					<b>Retreat:</b> If the defender wins, the attacker must retreat any units he moved onto the hex where the battle took place, back to where they began their movement. If the unit is unable to retreat to where they began their movement (due to prevailing winds) then the attacking unit will be captured by the defender. Diagram.<br>
					Units that attacked from adjacent hexes may remain where they are.<br>
					<b>Land Victory:</b> If the attacker wins a land battle, the defeated unit is captured. Place the captured piece on the victor's nearest developed hex. This knight is now considered a prisoner.<br>
					<b>Rescue:</b> If an opponent manages to seize a developed hex with prisoners on it, prisoners belonging to him are immediately freed and can now take actions. Any prisoners belonging to other players become the prisoners of the hex's new owner.<br>

					To seize a development, a player removes it from the board and replaces it with an equivalent development of their own color. He may then move the seizing unit onto the hex if he wishes, and it does not violate max occupancy.<br>
					Seizing an opponents buildings rewards players with victory tokens, however seizing back buildings previously owned by the player does not award tokens.<br>
					<b>Seizing an opponent's last development:</b> Players are not eliminated if all of their developments are seized. In the event an opponent seizes another player's last development, the victor receives 3 victory tokens in addition to the value of the development.<br>
					<b>Seizing Walls:</b> Any walls on hexes that are seized by an opponent also change ownership only if there are no adjacent hexes occupied by the original owner of the wall. This is not an all or none condition. It is possible that some walls could be converted and others not. Diagram<br>
					<b>Restrictions:</b><br>
					The Active player may not Seize more than 3 value of buildings of any one player in a single turn.<br>
