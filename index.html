			<div class="objective section">
				<p>The objective of the game is to be the player with the most victory tokens at the end of the game. Victory tokens are claimed in the following ways:</p>
				<p><b>Anytime - Multiple possible</b></p>
				<ol>
					<li><b>Battle:</b> For each combat unit that you defeat in battle collect a number of victory tokens equal to the value of that unit.</li>
					<li><b>Conquer:</b> For each development that you sieze from another player collect a number of victory tokens equal to the value of that development.</li>
					<li><b>Rescue:</b> For each prisoner that you free collect a number of victory tokens equal to the value of that unit.</li>
				</ol>

				<p><b>Anytime - Once per game per player</b></p>
					<ol>
						<li><b>Citadel:</b> 1 token per hex for completely enclosing one or more hexes with walls. Players do not have to build walls on edges bordering mountain hexes.</li>
						<li><b>Complex:</b> 3 tokens for building a Military Complex, which is defined as building a Castle, Fort, and Encampment on adjacent hexes.</li>
						<li><b>Great Wall:</b> 1 token for building a wall of length 5 or more. Mountains may be used to connect walls but do not count towards length.</li>
					</ol>

				<p><b>Once at the end (if a tie exists both players receive tokens) (counted as total combined values)</b></p>
					<ol>
						<li><b>General:</b> 3 tokens for the player with the most prisoners.</li>
						<li><b>Admiral:</b> 3 tokens for the player with the most sunken ships.</li>

					<li><b>Build the Map:</b><br>
						The size and geography of the map have a great effect on the game experience. Players are encouraged to be creative, and build the map however they like. However the following are some guidelines that help ensure an even distribution and balanced layout, as well as some recommended examples for new players.<br>
						<b>Size:</b><br>
						2 players - 6 hex edges<br>
						3 players - 7 hex edges<br>
						4 players - 8 hex edges<br>
						<div class="diagram">
							<img src='img/diagram-map-sizes.png' />
						</div>
						2 player map example:
						<div class="diagram">
							<img src='img/diagram-2-player-map-example.png' />
						</div>
					</li>

					<li><b>Starting Units:</b> Each player begins the game with the following units:<br>
						3 soldiers, 2 archers, 1 cavalry<br>
						3 caravels, 2 freighters, 1 galleon<br>
						Each player must load his 2 freighters with 3 land units each.
					</li>

					<li><b>Prevailing Winds:</b> Determine the direction of prevailing by flipping the Prevailing Winds Token. Place it in the center of the map.</li>

					<li>You are now ready to begin the game.</li>

		<h3 id="phases" class="section-header" onclick="toggle('phases');">
			<span class="toggler">+</span> Phases
		</h3>
			<div class="phases section">
				<p>The game consists of 3 phases that are 2 rounds each.</p>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Phase 1 - Landfall:</b>
						Each player in turn sequentially places one of any of his ships on any sea hex, until all players have placed all units.<br>
						Placement Restrictions:
						<ul>
							<li>Placing on a hex already occupied by another player is prohibited.</li>
							<li>Placing on a land hex is prohibited. All land units remain loaded on the freighters.</li>
							<li>Placing respects maximum occupancy rule. No more than 3 units may occupy the same hex.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li><b>Phase 2 - Build:</b>	Players may build developments, additional units, and activate and maneuver units around the map. No attack actions are allowed.</li>
					<li><b>Phase 3 - Battle:</b> All actions allowed in the build phase are also allowed in the battle phase. Additionally attack actions are allowed.</li>
				</ul>

			<div class="hexes section">
				<p>The geography of the map is important to consider in developing your military tactics and strategies:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Mountains:</b> Steep, rocky and treacherous, mountain hexes can not be occupied or built on.</li>
					<li><b>Land:</b> This is where all building and land battles will take place.</li>
					<li><b>Sea:</b> Sea hexes are where your naval maneuvering and battles will take place.</li>

		<h3 id="winds" class="section-header" onclick="toggle('winds');">
			<span class="toggler">+</span> Winds
		</h3>
			<div class="winds section">
				<p>The sea beyond the border of the map is the deep, open ocean, where strong, prevailing winds can greatly enhance a sea-worthy sailor's ability to travel long distances.<br>
				When ships move out into the deep sea, they may take advantage of the prevailing winds to travel from one edge of the map to the next adjacent edge in addition to each ship's normal movement range. Though they must travel in the same direction as the prevailing winds, which are either clockwise or counter-clockwise around the map.<br>
				Player's ships may enter the prevailing winds from any border sea hex, and exit into any border sea hex on the next edge of the map.</p>
				<div class="diagram">
					<p>In this example, the caravel is able to move into the prevailing winds and sail around the penninsula because the winds are clockwise and it has a movement range of 6.</p>
					<img src='img/diagram-winds-caravel.png' />
				</div>
				<p>
				Ships may not end their movement in the deep ocean. Ships must use 1 movement to enter prevailing winds and 1 movement to exit. If a ship does not have 2 spare movements it may not use prevailing winds.</p>
				<div class="diagram">
					<p>The galleon here is too far away from the edge of the map to make use of prevailing winds because it only has a movement range of 4.</p>

					<b>Movement:</b><br>
					Players may move units through hexes occupied by their own units, but must respect maximum occupancy rule, and only end movement in an eligible hex (see <a href="occupancy">Maximum Occupancy</a>).<br>
					During the build phase, units may pass through but not end their movement in hexes occupied by another player.<br>
					During the attack phase, movement into a hex occupied by another player initiates a battle.<br>
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Attack:</b> There are 2 types of attack:<br>
					<ul>
						<li><b>Close Combat:</b><br>
						Units can attack opponents in the same or adjacent hexes.<br>
						To resolve close combat attacks, both players involved roll a number of dice equal to the value of the unit participating in the battle. Compare only each player's highest die, and the greater value wins the battle. Ties must be re-rolled.
						</li>
						<li><b>Ranged:</b><br>
						Archers, Artillery and Galleons are capable of ranged attacks.<br>
						Ranged attacks can only extend in straight lines perpendicular to the center of each hex edge. Diagram - todo<br>
						Ranged attacks are blocked by mountains and walls.<br>
						Ranged attacks can not target a hex if a closer hex in the same line of sight is occupied by opponent units. Diagram.<br>
						To resolve a ranged attack, the attacker rolls a number of dice equal to the value of the unit. If any die result is 1, 2 or 3 the attack is successful.<br>
						Ranged attack accuracy decreases with range. For attacks at range 2, only a die roll of 1 or 2 scores a hit. At range 3, only a 1 scores a hit.<br>

						<b>Flanking:</b> The attacker may add 1 additional die for attacking from a flank, 2 for attacking from a rear flank, and 3 for attacking from the rear.<br>
						<b>Feint:</b> The 'front' of a hex is determined by the direction of the first attack. Subsequent attacks may utilize Flanking advantage.<br>
						Diagram
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Attrition:</b> The attacker may add 2 additional dice for attacking the same hex from the same direction 3 times.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Surrender:</b> If a player is able to surround enemy units, and cut off all escape routes, then the defender must immediately surrender and all units are captured.<br>
						Units must be surrounded on all adjacent sea and land hexes.<br>
						Surrounded units must be unable to move or build in any direction. This means that an adjacent hex occupied by the same player's units at maximum occupancy is not eligible to move into, unless there are available hexes beyond the occupied hex (players can still move through hexes at max occupancy). Thus it is possible for a player's own units to block escape routes.<br>
						Diagram

					<b>Retreat:</b> If the defender wins, the attacker must retreat any units he moved onto the hex where the battle took place, back to where they began their movement. If the unit is unable to retreat to where they began their movement (due to prevailing winds) then the attacking unit will be captured by the defender. Diagram.<br>
					Units that attacked from adjacent hexes may remain where they are.<br>
					<b>Land Victory:</b> If the attacker wins a land battle, the defeated unit is captured. Place the captured piece on the victor's nearest developed hex. This knight is now considered a prisoner.<br>
					<b>Rescue:</b> If an opponent manages to seize a developed hex with prisoners on it, prisoners belonging to him are immediately freed and can now take actions. Any prisoners belonging to other players become the prisoners of the hex's new owner.<br>
					<b>Sea Victory:</b> If the attacker wins at sea, the victor sinks the loser's ship. Remove it from the board, and places it in an area near him designated as his ship graveyard.<br>
					<b>Occupation:</b> The attacker may move his victorious unit onto the hex that was attacked if no enemy units remain.
