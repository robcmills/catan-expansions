			<span class="toggler">+</span> Objective
		</h3>
		<div class="objective section">
			<p>The objective of the game is to be the player with the most victory tokens at the end of the game. Victory tokens are claimed in the following ways:</p>
			<p><b>Anytime - Multiple possible</b></p>
			<ol>
				<li><b>Battle:</b> For each Combat Unit that you defeat in battle collect a number of victory tokens equal to its value.</li>
				<li><b>Seize:</b> For each Building that you sieze from another player collect a number of victory tokens equal to its value.<br>
				<b>Bonus:</b> Seizing an opponent's last Building grants the victor a 3 token bonus in addition to the value of the Building.
				</li>
				<li><b>Rescue:</b> For each prisoner that you free collect a number of victory tokens equal to its value.</li>
			</ol>

			<p><b>Once at the end (if a tie exists both players receive tokens)</b></p>
				<ol>
					<li><b>General:</b> 3 tokens for the player with the most value of prisoners.</li>
					<li><b>Admiral:</b> 3 tokens for the player with the most value of sunken ships.</li>
					<li><b>Emperor:</b> 3 tokens for the player with the most value of buildings.</li>

				<li><b>Build the Map:</b><br>
					The size and geography of the map have a great effect on the game experience. Players are encouraged to be creative, and build the map however they like. However the following are some guidelines that help ensure an even distribution and balanced layout, as well as some recommended examples for new players.<br>
					<b>Mountains:</b> Mountains can be used to great effect defensively, and can greatly increase the potential size of a player's citadel. It is very important that the number of mountains on the map be balanced and spread out. Too many mountains in one area will make that area too defensible and unless all players have access to a similar configuration of mountains, it could easily be too advantageous to a single player.<br>
					<b>Border:</b> Any land hexes adjacent to the edge of the map are equivalent to being bordered by mountains, since opponents can not attack from the deep sea beyond the edge of the map. Additionally, these hexes tend to be the furthest away from all other players, making them very defensible. To ensure a well balanced map, the border hexes on each edge of the map should be mostly, if not all, sea hexes.<br>
					<b>Size:</b><br>
					2 players - 6 hex edges<br>
					3 players - 7 hex edges<br>
					4 players - 8 hex edges<br>

				</li>

				<li><b>Starting Units:</b> Each player begins the game with the following units:<br>
					3 infantry, 2 archers, 1 cavalry<br>
					3 caravels, 2 longships, 1 galleon<br>
					3 camps, 2 forts, 1 castle<br>
					9 walls<br>
					1 artillery<br>
				</li>

				<li><b>Prevailing Winds:</b> Determine the direction of prevailing by flipping the Prevailing Winds Token. Place it in the center of the map.</li>

				<li><b>Turn Order:</b> Randomly determine which player will go first. Turn order is the opposite direction of Prevailing Winds for the remainder of the game.</li>

				<li>You are now ready to begin the game.</li>

				<li><b>Mountains:</b> Steep, rocky and treacherous, mountain hexes can not be occupied or built on.</li>
				<li><b>Land:</b> This is where all building and land battles will take place.</li>

		</h3>
		<div class="winds section">
			<p>The sea beyond the border of the map is the deep, open ocean, where strong, prevailing winds can greatly enhance a sea-worthy sailor's ability to travel long distances.<br>
			When ships move out into the deep sea, they may take advantage of the prevailing winds to travel from one edge of the map to the next adjacent edge in addition to each ship's normal movement range. Though they must travel in the same direction as the prevailing winds, which are either clockwise or counter-clockwise around the map.<br>
			Player's ships may enter the prevailing winds from any border sea hex, and exit into any border sea hex on the next edge of the map.</p>
			<div class="diagram">
				<p>In this example, the caravel is able to move into the prevailing winds and sail around the penninsula because the winds are clockwise and it has a movement range of 6.</p>
				<img src='img/diagram-winds-caravel.png' />
			</div>
			<p>
			Ships may not end their movement in the deep ocean. Ships must use 1 movement to enter prevailing winds and 1 movement to exit. If a ship does not have 2 spare movements it may not use prevailing winds.</p>
			<div class="diagram">
				<p>The galleon here is too far away from the edge of the map to make use of prevailing winds because it only has a movement range of 4.</p>

					Units can attack opponents in the same or adjacent hexes.<br>
					To resolve close combat attacks, both players involved roll a number of dice equal to the value of the unit participating in the battle. Compare only each player's highest die, and the greater value wins the battle. Ties must be re-rolled.

					<li><b>Ranged:</b><br>
					Archers, Artillery and Galleons are capable of ranged attacks.<br>
					Ranged attacks can only extend in straight lines perpendicular to the center of each hex edge.<br>
					<div class="diagram">

					</div>
					To resolve a ranged attack, the attacker rolls a number of dice equal to the value of the unit. If any die result is 1, 2 or 3 the attack is successful.<br>
					Ranged attack accuracy decreases with range. For attacks at range 2, only a die roll of 1 or 2 is successful. At range 3, only a 1 is successful.

				<b>Sinking a Longship loaded with Units:</b> If a longship loaded with units (that are not archers) is defeated in Naval battle, the victor captures all units aboard and sinks the longship. If archers are aboard, they must be defeated (and captured) prior to sinking the longship.<br>

				<b>Occupation:</b> The attacker may optionally move his victorious unit onto the hex that was attacked if no enemy units remain.<br>
				<b>Defender Wins:</b> If the defender wins, Units that attacked from adjacent hexes may remain where they are and no further action is taken.<br>
				<b>Retreat:</b> If the attacker and defender are on the same hex, and the defender wins the battle, the attacker must retreat his unit back to where it began movement.<br>

				If the development is defended, the attacking player must first defeat all defenders.<br>
				To seize a development, a player removes it from the board and replaces it with an equivalent development of their own color. He may then move the seizing unit onto the hex.<br>
				<b>Rescue:</b> If an opponent manages to seize a developed hex with prisoners on it, prisoners belonging to him are freed and can now be Activated. Any prisoners belonging to other players become the prisoners of the hex's new owner.<br>
				Seizing an opponents buildings rewards players with victory tokens, however seizing back buildings previously owned by the player does not award tokens.<br>
				<b>Seizing an opponent's last development:</b> Players are not eliminated if all of their developments are seized. In the event an opponent seizes another player's last development, the victor receives 3 victory tokens in addition to the value of the development.<br>
				<b>Seizing Walls:</b> Any walls on hexes that are seized by an opponent also change ownership only if there are no adjacent hexes occupied by the original owner of the wall. This is not an all or none condition. It is possible that some walls could be converted and others not. Diagram<br>
