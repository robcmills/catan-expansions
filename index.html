		<h1>Conquest âš” v0.81</h1>
			<p>For the glory of your country! New islands have been discovered across the Emerald Sea and you have been ordered by your King to claim land for your country. However, you are not the only one who hopes to discover riches on foreign soil. Gather your knights and set sail. Conquest is a game of colonization and medieval combat.</p>

		<h3 id="setup">Setup</h3>
			<p>Build the map according to the following diagram:</p>
			<p>Todo</p>

		<h3 id="starting">Starting Actions</h3>
			<p>
				Each player rolls 2 dice. Highest roll goes first.<br>
				<b>Landfall:</b> The first player begins by landing his ship on any island. Choose any coastal sea hex and place one ship (at no cost).<br>
				<b>Disembark:</b> Then place one knight on any terrain hex adjacent to the ship.<br>
				<b>Camp:</b> Then place a camp on the hex occupied by the knight.<br>
				Optionally, the knight may execute a movement into any adjacent hex and build after the movement.<br>
				This ends the first players turn, and play rotates to the <b>right</b>.<br>
				Each player executes their starting actions in turn.<br>
				When all players have finished their starting actions the player who started last, is the first player to start the game and execute a normal turn.<br>
				Play then proceeds to the <b>left</b> for the remainder of the game.
			</p>

		<h3 id="gold">Gold ðŸ’°</h3>
			<p>
				Gold is the primary currency of the game. You will use gold to build castles, knights and ships.<br>
				At the beginning of each player's turn he receives 5 gold.<br>
			</p>

		<h3 id="hexes">Hexes</h3>
			<p>The geography of the map is important to consider in developing your military tactics and strategies:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Mountains:</b> Steep, rocky and treacherous, mountain hexes can not be occupied or built on.</li>
				<li><b>Forrest:</b> The dense trees provide excellent cover against archer attacks from range. Archers can not attack troops in the forrest from adjacent hexes. Does not affect close attacks (same hex).<br>
				Forrests are habitat to deer, elk, and other big game. Hunter's are more likely to have successful hunts (roll a 1, 2 or 3).</li>
				<li><b>Plains:</b> The open, rolling grasslands are ideal for horses. Extend cavalry movement to 4.<br>
				There is no cover from hails of arrows. Increase archers attack rolls +1.</li>
				<li><b>Desert:</b> The deep sands and hot sun make travel difficult. Cavalry movement is reduced to 1.<br>
				Hunting may not be performed in desert hexes.</li>
				<li><b>Sea:</b> The open ocean! Be wary of storms.</li>
				<li><b>Reef:</b> Warm, shallow waters and coral attract fish. Ships fishing in reef hexes are more likely to catch fish (roll a 1, 2 or 3)</li>
			</ul>

		<h3 id="ships">Ships â›µ</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Ship: 4 movement</li>
				<li>Galley: +1 attack, +1 defense (limit 1)</li>
				<li>Freighter: +2 movement, +3 transport, -attack, -defend (limit 3)<br>
					Freighters can transport up to 3 knights of any type.<br>
					Freighters can not attack or defend other ships or coastal buildings, but they can defend themselves like normal ships.
					<p><b>Loading and unloading freighters:</b><br>
						Loading knights onto a freighters is considered 1 movement that counts against each knightâ€™s movement range. This means normal knights can only be loaded onto a freighter and transported to a different part of the board, but then can not be unloaded on the same turn.<br>
						Cavalry, on the other hand, may continue their movement after being transported by a freighter (granted they still have movement points left).<br>
						Archers have a movement range of 1, so like knights they can only be loaded and transported, but because they have an attack range of +1 they could then attack a coastal hex, or enemy ships in the same or adjacent hexes. This makes the combination of a freighter loaded with 3 archers a powerful weapon.
					</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>On a player's turn he may build <b>2 knights or 2 ships or 1 knight and 1 ship</b></p>
			<p> In order to build a ship, players must have a soldier, camp, fort or castle on the coast.</p>
			<p>Newly built ships are placed on any sea hex adjacent to any of the player's coastal buildings. Ships occupy the center of sea hexes.</p>
			<p>On a players turn, each ship is limited to <b>2 actions</b> (and each player is limited to taking actions with a max of 6 units total per turn). Once the player has resolved a ship's actions, lay the piece on its side to denote that it has completed its actions. At the end of the turn, reset all ships to their upright position.</p>
			<p>Each action must be unique. A player may not move the same ship twice or attack with the same ship twice.</p>
			<p>Ship actions can occur at any point in a player's turn.</p>
			<p>Ship actions include the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Movement:</b> Ships can sail <b>up to 4</b> sea hexes per movement. (Multiple ships may occupy the same sea hex and ships may sail through sea hexes occupied by another player's ship)</li>
				<li><b>Attack:</b> Ships can attack another player's ships if they both occupy the same sea hex. Ships are able to attack knights and buildings on coastal hexes as well. Conversely, only archers can attack a ship from a coastal hex. To resolve an attack, both players involved roll one die and the higher die wins the battle. A tie must be re-rolled. The results of an attack:
					<ul>
						<li>If ship to ship attack, victor sinks loser's ship, removes it from the board, and places it in an area near him designated as his ship graveyard. Sunken ships are counted toward the Admiral Victory Token condition.</li>
						<li>If ship to coastal building attack (no defending ships - see below), victor occupies loser's building (removes it from the board and replaces it with his own)</li>
						<li>If the defender wins no action is taken (advantage to attacker)</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li><b>Breach a Sea Wall</b> see <a href="#walls">Walls</a> section below</li>
				<li><b>Fish</b> Roll one die and if the result is 1 or 2, collect 1 fish. 2 Fish may be exchanged for 1 gold.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><b>Ship benefits:</b> Players who have built ships also may:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Defend:</b> When a ship is attacking a coastal building, if the defender has a ship on an adjacent sea hex, the attacker must first attack the defending ship. Similarly, regular ships may defend galleys and freighters if they are on the same sea hex. A newly built ship may defend on the same turn. Ships can not defend coastal building from knight attacks. Defending does not count as an action.</li>
				<li><b>Build:</b> Players may build on any coastal hex that is adjacent to one of their ships.</li>
			</ul>

		<h3 id="knights">Knights âš”</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Knight</li>
				<li>Archer: +1 attack range</li>
				<li>Cavalry: +2 movement</li>
			</ul>
			<p>On a player's turn he may build <b>2 knights or 2 ships or 1 knight and 1 ship</b></p>
			<p>Newly built Knights are placed on any hex with a camp, fort or castle belonging to the player.</p>
			<p>On a players turn, each knight is limited to <b>2 actions</b> (and each player is limited to taking actions with a max of 6 units total per turn). Once the player has resolved a knight's actions, lay the piece on its side to denote that it has completed its actions. At the end of the turn, reset all knights to their upright position.</p>
			<p>Each action must be unique. A player may not move the same knight twice or attack with the same knight twice.</p>
			<p>Knight actions can occur at any point in a player's turn. For example, at the beginning of a player's turn, he may move his knight to a nearby hex, and then build a camp there.</p>
			<p>Knight actions include the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Movement</b> Knights can move <b>1 hex</b> per movement (except cavalry which can move 3). Multiple knights may occupy the same hex. Knights may move through hexes occupied by another player's knights, however they may not move through another player's camp, fort or castle hexes. Knights may move onto an opponents hex with a building (to attack) but that ends movement regardless of movement range.</li>
				<li><b>Attack</b> Knights can attack another player's knights or buildings if they both occupy the same hex (except for archers, which can attack adjacent hexes). Both players involved roll one die and the higher die wins the battle. A tie must be re-rolled. The results of an attack:
					<ul>
						<li>When a knight is defeated in battle the victor captures him and places the piece in an area near the player designated as his prison. Captured knights are counted towards the General Victory Tokens condition.</li>
						<li>If knight to building attack (no defending knights - see below), victor occupies loser's building (removes it from the board and replaces it with his own)</li>
						<li>If the defender wins no action is taken (advantage to attacker)</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li><b>Breach a Wall</b> see <a href="#walls">Walls</a> section below</li>
				<li><b>Hunt</b> Roll one die and if the result is 1 or 2, collect 1 meat. 2 Meat may be exchanged for 1 gold.</li>

			</ul>
			<p><b>Knight benefits:</b> Players who have built knights also may:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Defend:</b> When a knight is attacking a building, if the defender has a knight on the hex, that knight is defending that building, and the attacker must first attack the defending knight before attacking the building. Similarly, knights may defend archers and cavalry. Archers, because of their +1 attack range, may defend settlements on adjacent hexes. During attack phase, a newly built knight may defend on the same turn. Defending does not count as an action.</li>
				<li><b>Build:</b> Players may build on any hex that is occupied by one of their knights and that has no opponent buildings.</li>
			</ul>

		<h3 id="walls">Walls</h3>
			<p>Walls are a great way to defend yourself from attack, however they are not guaranteed to protect you.</p>
			<p>Walls may be built on any edge of a player's occupied or built hexes</p>
      <p>Once per a player's turn, he may deconstruct an existing wall and rebuild it in a new location at no cost</p>
      <p>Knights may not attack or move through opponent walls, however a player's own knights may move freely or attack through his own walls</p>
      <p><b>Breaching a Wall</b>
	      <ul>
		      <li>Players may attempt to breach an opponent's wall if he has a knight occupying an adjacent hex.</li>
		      <li>To breach, roll one die and if the result is a 6, the breach is succesful</li>
		      <li>Upon successful breach of a wall, it is removed from the board and the player may then attack the newly exposed hex.</li>
		      <li>Breaching counts as a knight action.</li>
		      <li>Breaching may be attempted more than once if the player has more than one knight on adjacent hexes who have not exhausted their actions.</li>
		      <li>Ships may attempt to breach coastal walls</li>
		    </ul>
		   </p>

		<h3 id="castles">Castles</h3>
			<p>Players who have built a castle may increase their production of combat units to 3 per turn.</p>

		<h3 id="phases">Game Phases</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Phase 1 - Build:</b>	During this phase no attack actions are allowed.</li>
				<li><b>Phase 2 - Battle:</b> During this phase attack actions are allowed and turn order is modified:
					<p><b>Battle phase turn order:</b> At the start of each round, recalculate each player's points. The player with the least points goes first, highest last.</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Each phase lasts 3 rounds. Implement a counter to keep track.</p>

		<h3 id="rewards">Rewards</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>At the end of each round, the player with the least points may draw one free card.</li>
			</ul>

		<h3 id="cards">Cards</h3>
			<p>Cards may be purchased for 2 gold and have some interesting effects on the game. Roll 2 dice to determine which card is drawn. Resolve its effects immediately.</p>
			<ol start="2">
				<!--2--><li><b>Grace of God:</b> Your devout offerings and devotion have curried you the benevolence of the Gods. Receive 1 victory token.</li>
				<!--3--><li><b>Forrest Fire:</b> A dry season and lighting strikes start a deadly forrest fire. Randomly choose a forrest hex and destroy any buildings present. Any knights occupying the hex are able to flee to adjacent hexes. Change the hex to a desert.</li>
				<!--4--><li><b>Disease:</b> A mysterious sickness strikes a knight belonging to the player with the most points. The victim of disease must assign a number to each of his knights (including cavalry and archers) and roll a die to determine which one perishes.</li>
				<!--5--><li><b>Gemstones:</b> You unearth a deposit of rare minerals that fetch a high price at market. Collect 6 gold.</li>
				<!--6--><li><b>Relic:</b> You have acquired a rare religious relic of supernatural power. Grant this valuable item to the knight of your choice and add 1 to all his battle rolls (attack and defense) for the remainder of the game. When hunting a 3 also results in a successful hunt. (place a chit underneath the knight to mark this ability)</li>
				<!--7--><li><b>Artillery:</b> Your blacksmith has discovered how to harness the power of black powder by forging a denser metal. You may now build artillery for 2 gold (limit 2). You may build artillery on any occupied hex. Knights may fire the artillery as one of their actions (they must be on the same hex). Artillery has an attack range of +2, and is more effective at breaching walls (a 5 or 6 is a successful breach). Artillery may be moved by any knight.</li>
				<!--8--><li><b>Liquid Fire:</b> Your alchemist has discovered an incendiary formula that can be used in naval warfare to great effect because it ignites upon contact with water. Grant this valuable weapon to the ship of your choice and add 1 to all its battle rolls (attack and defense) for the remainder of the game. (place a chit underneath the ship to mark this ability)</li>
				<!--9--><li><b>Bountiful Harvest:</b> Your farm produces a surplus this year that you are able to sell at market. Collect 4 gold.</li>
				<!--10--><li><b>Tempest:</b> A violent storm occurs and sinks a ship belonging to the player with the most points. The victim of the storm must assign a number to each of his ships (including galleys and freighters) and roll a die to determine which one is sunk.</li>
				<!--11--><li><b>Dragon Attack:</b>
					A dragon attacks the player with the most points.<br>
					Assign a number to each of his buildings (including forts and castles) and roll a die to determine which one is attacked.<br>
					A building attacked by the dragon is completely destroyed and removed from the board.<br>
					If the building being attacked is defended by one or more knights, then the player has a chance to fight the dragon. Two dice are rolled. One represents the player, the other the dragon. Add +2 to the dragon roll. The higher number wins. Ties are re-rolled.<br>
				</li>
				<!--12--><li><b>Wrath of God:</b> Your sins have not gone unnoticed by the Gods. Lose 1 victory token. If you have no victory tokens, no action is taken.</li>
			</ol>

		<h3 id="points">Points</h3>

				<li><b>Armada:</b> 1 token for a standing navy of 6 or more ships (once per player)</li>
				<li><b>Legion:</b> 1 token for a standing army of 6 or more knights (once per player)</li>
				<li><b>Warfare:</b> 1 token each time a player executes 6 attack actions in one turn</li>
