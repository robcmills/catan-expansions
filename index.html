		<h1>Conquest âš” v0.9</h1>
			<p>For the glory of your country! New islands have been discovered across the Emerald Sea and you have been ordered by your King to claim the land for your country. However, you are not the only one who hopes to discover riches on foreign soil. Gather your knights and set sail. Conquest is a game of colonization and medieval combat.</p>

		<h3 id="objective">Objective</h3>
			<p>The objective of Conquest is to be the player with the most claimed land at the end of the game. Land is claimed in the following ways:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Occupying:</b> The presence of a player's knight on a hex means that hex is occupied by that player.</li>
				<li><b>Developing:</b> The presence of a player's encampment, fort or castle on a hex means that hex is developed by that player.</li>
				<li><b>Citadel:</b> Players may claim hexes by surrounding them with walls. Edges bordering mountain hexes do not require a wall to be built.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In addition to claiming land, players may also earn <a href="#victory">Victory Tokens</a> in a variety of ways during the course of the game. At the end of the game, the number of claimed hexes and victory tokens are added to determine the winner.</p>

		<h3 id="setup">Setup</h3>
			<p>Build the map according to the following diagrams:</p>
			<p>Todo</p>

		<h3 id="starting">Starting Actions</h3>
			<p>
				Each player rolls 2 dice. Highest roll starts first.<br>
				<b>Landfall:</b> The first player begins by landing his ship on any island. Choose any coastal sea hex and place one caravel ship (at no cost).<br>
				<b>Disembark:</b> Then place one infantry knight on any terrain hex adjacent to the ship.<br>
				<b>Camp:</b> Then place an encampment on the hex occupied by the knight.<br>
				Optionally, the knight may execute a movement to another hex and build after the movement.<br>
				This ends the first players turn, and play rotates to the <b>right</b>.<br>
				Each player executes their starting actions in turn.<br>
				When all players have finished their starting actions the player who started last, is the first player to start the game and execute a normal turn.<br>
				Play then proceeds to the <b>left</b>.
			</p>

		<h3 id="gold">Gold ðŸ’°</h3>
			<p>
				Gold is the primary currency of the game. You will use gold to build castles, knights and ships.<br>
				At the beginning of each player's turn he receives 6 gold.<br>
			</p>

		<h3 id="hexes">Hexes</h3>
			<p>The geography of the map is important to consider in developing your military tactics and strategies:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Mountains:</b> Steep, rocky and treacherous, mountain hexes can not be occupied or built on.</li>
				<li><b>Forrest:</b> The dense trees provide excellent cover against archer attacks from range. Archers attacking troops in the forrest must subtract 1 from their attack rolls.<br>
				Forrests are habitat to deer, elk, and other big game. Hunter's are more likely to have successful hunts (roll a 1, 2 or 3).</li>
				<li><b>Plains:</b> The open, rolling grasslands are ideal for horses. Extend cavalry movement +2.<br>
				Plains provide no cover from hails of arrows. Increase archers attack rolls +1.</li>
				<li><b>Desert:</b> Deep sands and hot sun. Hunting may not be performed in desert hexes.</li>
				<li>
					<b>Sea:</b> Sea hexes are where your naval maneuvering and battles will take place.<br>
					<b>Prevailing Wind Direction:</b> The arrows on some sea hexes represent the direction of prevailing winds. When ships move through a sea hex in the same direction as the prevailing winds (tail wind) they may add +1 to their movement range per hex. In other words, traveling with the wind does not cost any movement points. Conversely, when sailing against prevailing winds (head wind), movement range is reduced by -1 per hex.
					<br>
					Ships entering a sea hex to attack enemy ships may add +1 to their battle rolls if entering the hex in the same direction as the prevailing winds.
				</li>
				<li><b>Reef:</b> Warm, shallow waters and coral attract fish. Ships fishing in reef hexes are more likely to catch fish (roll a 1, 2 or 3)</li>
			</ul>

		<h3 id="occupancy">Maximum Occupancy</h3>
			<p>Undeveloped hexes may be occupied by only one unit. Encampments can support 2 units, forts 3, and castles 4.<br>
			Prisoners do not count toward occupancy.<br>
			A player may not build knights on a developed hex that is already occupied by its maximum occupancy. He must first move knights off the hex before building additional units.</p>
			<p>Diagram - todo</p>


		<h3 id="ships">Ships â›µ</h3>
			<p>Types of ships:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Caravel:</b> A small, maneuverable sailing ship with lateen sails, capable of basic attacking and defending. 5 movement</li>
				<li><b>Galley:</b> Large warship with powerful cannons, but slower and less sea-worthy. (limit 1) 3 movement, +2 attack, +2 defense, 3 attack range (with diminishing accuracy: -1 at range 2, -2 at range 3)</li>
				<li><b>Freighter:</b> A large, oar-powered ship primarily for transporting troops. 7 movement, +3 transport, -attack, -defend (limit 3)<br>
					Freighters can transport up to 3 knights of any type.<br>
					Freighters can not attack or defend other ships or coastal buildings, but they can defend themselves like normal ships.
					<p><b>Loading and unloading freighters:</b><br>
						Loading knights onto a freighters is considered 1 movement that counts against each knightâ€™s movement range.<br>
						Archers loaded onto a freighter can attack coastal hexes or enemy ships. The combination of a freighter loaded with 3 archers is a powerful weapon.
					</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p><b>Combat Unit Cap:</b> On a player's turn he may only build <b>2 knights or 2 ships or 1 knight and 1 ship</b> (unless he has built a castle, in which case his production capacity increases to 3)</p>
			<p> In order to build a ship, players must have an encampment, fort or castle on the coast.</p>
			<p>Newly built ships are placed on any sea hex adjacent to any of the player's coastal buildings.</p>
			<p>On a players turn, each ship is limited to <b>2 actions</b>. Once the player has resolved a ship's actions, lay the piece on its side to denote that it has completed its actions. At the end of the turn, reset all ships to their upright position.</p>
			<p>Each action must be unique. A player may not move the same ship twice or attack with the same ship twice.</p>
			<p>Ship actions can occur at any point in a player's turn.</p>
			<p>Ship actions include the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Movement:</b> Ships can sail across sea hexes. Only during the build phase may ships sail through sea hexes occupied by another player's ships. During the attack phase, passing through a sea hex occupied by another player necessitates a battle.</li>
				<li><b>Attack:</b> Ships can attack another player's ships if they occupy an adjacent sea hex. Ships are able to attack knights and buildings on coastal hexes as well. Conversely, only archers can attack a ship from a coastal hex.<br>
				To resolve an attack, both players involved roll one die and the higher die wins the battle. A tie must be re-rolled.<br>
				<b>Resolving an attack:</b>
					<ul>
						<li>If ship to ship attack, victor sinks loser's ship, removes it from the board, and places it in an area near him designated as his ship graveyard. Sunken ships are counted toward the Admiral Victory Token condition.</li>
						<li>If ship to coastal building attack (no defending ships - see below), victor occupies loser's building (removes it from the board and replaces it with his own)</li>
						<li>If the defender wins no action is taken (advantage to attacker)</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li><b>Breach a Sea Wall</b> see <a href="#walls">Walls</a> section below</li>
				<li><b>Fish</b> Roll one die and if the result is 1, collect 1 fish. If the result is a 2, collect 2 fish. 2 Fish may be exchanged for 1 gold.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><b>Ship benefits:</b> Players who have built ships also may:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Defend:</b> When a ship is attacking a coastal building, if the defender has a ship on an adjacent sea hex, the attacker must first attack the defending ship. Similarly, regular ships may defend galleys and freighters if they are on the same sea hex. A newly built ship may defend on the same turn. Ships can not defend coastal building from knight attacks. Defending does not count as an action.</li>
				<li><b>Build:</b> Players may build on any coastal hex that is adjacent to one of their ships. Building does not count as an action.</li>
			</ul>

		<h3 id="knights">Knights âš”</h3>
			<p>Types of knights:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Infantry: 4 movement</li>
				<li>Archer: 3 movement, 3 attack range* (with diminishing accuracy: -1 at range 2, -2 at range 3)</li>
				<li>Cavalry: 5 movement, +2 attack</li>
			</ul>
			<p>On a player's turn he may build <b>2 knights or 2 ships or 1 knight and 1 ship</b></p>
			<p>Newly built Knights are placed on any hex with an encampment, fort or castle belonging to the player.</p>
			<p>On a players turn, each knight is limited to <b>2 actions</b>. Once the player has resolved a knight's actions, lay the piece on its side to denote that it has completed its actions. At the end of the turn, reset all knights to their upright position.</p>
			<p>Each action must be unique. A player may not move the same knight twice or attack with the same knight twice.</p>
			<p>Knight actions can occur at any point in a player's turn. For example, at the beginning of a player's turn, he may move his knight to a nearby hex, and then build a camp there.</p>
			<p>Knight actions include the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Movement:</b> Only during the build phase may knights pass through hexes occupied by another player's knights. Knights may pass through hexes occupied by their own units.</li>
				<li><b>Attack:</b> Knights can attack another player's knights or developments if they occupy adjacent hexes (archers can attack at range). Both players involved roll one die and the higher die wins the battle. A tie must be re-rolled. The results of an attack:
					<ul>
						<li>When a knight is defeated in battle the victor captures him and places the piece on his nearest developed hex. This knight is considered a prisoner. If an opponent manages to seize a developed hex with prisoners on it, prisoners belonging to him are immediately freed and can now take actions. Any prisoners belonging to other players become the prisoners of the hex's new owner.</li>
						<li>If knight to building attack (no defending knights - see below), victor occupies loser's building (removes it from the board and replaces it with his own)</li>
						<li>If the defender wins no action is taken (advantage to attacker)</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li><b>Breach a Wall:</b> see <a href="#walls">Walls</a> section below</li>
				<li><b>Hunt:</b> Roll one die and if the result is 1, collect 1 meat. If the result is a 2, collect 2 meat. 2 Meat may be exchanged for 1 gold.</li>
				<li><b>Fire Artillery:</b> Artillery units must be fired by a knight, and this constitutes a different action than attacking. Thus it is possible for a knight to fire artillery to breach an adjacent wall, and then attack the newly exposed hex.<br>
				But artillery may also be used to attack knights and ships.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><b>Knight benefits:</b> Players who have built knights also may:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Defend:</b> Knights may defend other knights. In other words, infantry may defend archers and cavalry. Defending does not count as an action.</li>
				<li><b>Build:</b> Players may build on any hex that is occupied by one of their knights.</li>
			</ul>

		<h3 id="tactics">Tactics</h3>
			<p><b>Flanking:</b> The attacker receives +2 advantage for attacking from a flank, +4 for attacking from a rear flank, and +6 for attacking from the rear.</p>
			<p><b>Forcing a Surrender</b> If the attacker is able to surround a hex (attack from all exposed directions) the defender must immediately surrender and all units are captured</p>

		<h3 id="artillery">Artillery</h3>
			<p>Artillery are basically cannons mounted on small chariots, and are quite effective at breaching walls (roll a 3,4,5 or 6 to breach). Artillery require a knight on the same hex to be used (as an action).<br>
			Artillery can be moved by any knight.<br>
			Note that although artillery are an extremely powerful weapon, they are a double edged sword because an opponent can seize your artillery and then use it against you. If an opponent defeats all knights on the hex where an artillery is located, he may occupy the hex and use the artillery for himself.</p>

		<h3 id="walls">Walls</h3>
			<p>Walls are a great way to defend yourself from attack, however they are not guaranteed to protect you.</p>
			<p>Walls may be built on any edge of a player's occupied or built hexes</p>
      <p>Once per a player's turn, he may deconstruct an existing wall and rebuild it in a new location at no cost</p>
      <p>Knights may not attack or move through opponent walls, however a player's own knights may move freely or attack through his own walls</p>
      <p><b>Breaching a Wall</b>
	      <ul>
		      <li>Players may attempt to breach an opponent's wall if he has a knight occupying an adjacent hex.</li>
		      <li>To breach, roll one die and if the result is a 5 or 6, the breach is succesful</li>
		      <li>Upon successful breach of a wall, it is removed from the board and the player may then attack the newly exposed hex.</li>
		      <li>Breaching counts as a knight action.</li>
		      <li>Breaching may be attempted more than once if the player has more than one knight on adjacent hexes who have not exhausted their actions.</li>
		      <li>Ships may attempt to breach coastal walls</li>
		    </ul>
		   </p>

		<h3 id="castles">Castles</h3>
			<p>Players who have built a castle may increase their production of combat units to 3 per turn.</p>

		<h3 id="phases">Game Phases</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Phase 1 - Build:</b>	During this phase no attack actions are allowed.</li>
				<li><b>Phase 2 - Battle:</b> During this phase attack actions are allowed and turn order is modified:
					<p><b>Battle phase turn order:</b> At the start of each round, recalculate each player's points. The player with the least points goes first, highest last.</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Each phase lasts 3 rounds. Implement a counter to keep track.</p>

		<h3 id="points">Points</h3>
			<p>Points are used during the game, but do not determine the winner. Points are the same as building costs.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Building: 2 points per artillery, 1 point per wall, 1 per encampment, 2 per fort, 3 per castle</li>
				<li>Armies: 1 point per infantry, 2 per archer, 3 per cavalry</li>
				<li>Navies: 1 point per caravel, 2 per freighter, 3 per galley</li>
			</ul>

  <h3 id="victory">Victory Tokens</h3>
		<p>Victory tokens can be earned in the following ways:</p>
		<p><b>Anytime - Multiple possible</b></p>
			<ol>
				<li><b>Conquer:</b> 1 tokens for each encampment that you sieze from another player. 2 tokens for forts, 3 for castles</li>
				<li><b>Siege:</b> 1 token for each wall breached</li>
				<li><b>Battle:</b> 1 token for each knight you capture or ship you sink.</li>
				<li><b>Rescue:</b> 1 token for each prisoner you free.</li>
				<li><b>Castle:</b> 1 token for each built castle</li>
			</ol>

		<p><b>Anytime - Once per game per player</b></p>
			<ol>
				<li><b>Citadel:</b> 1 token for completely enclosing one or more hexes with walls. Note that you do not have to build walls on edges bordering mountain hexes.</li>
				<li><b>Complex:</b> 1 token for building on 3 or more adjacent hexes</li>
				<li><b>Great Wall:</b> 1 token for building a wall of length 5 or more</li>
			</ol>

		<p><b>Once at the end (if a tie exists both players receive tokens)</b></p>
			<ol>
				<li><b>General:</b> 3 tokens for the player with the most prisoners.</li>
				<li><b>Admiral:</b> 3 tokens for the player with the most sunken ships.</li>
			</ol>
