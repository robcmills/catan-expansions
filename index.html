		<h1>Dragons and Krakens</h1> 
			<p>D&amp;K is an expansion to the game of Catan. All rules of the base game apply with the following new rules:</p>

		<h3>Gold</h3>
			<p>Gold hexes are added to the board and operate much the same as they do in the Explorers and Pirates Expansion:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Gold hexes produce one gold each time their resource number is rolled during a production round</li>
				<li>2 gold may be traded to the bank for any 1 resource</li>
				<li>Gold may be traded with other players</li>
			</ul>

		<h3>The Dragon</h3>
			<p>For every 7 gold that is produced by gold hexes, the dragon attacks the player with the most victory points. This attack occurs immediately after resource production roll. The victim of the dragon attack must assign a number to each of his settlements / cities and knights and roll a die to determine which one is attacked. A settlement attacked by the dragon is destroyed and removed from the board. Cities are downgraded to settlements. Knights are killed and removed from the board.</p>

		<h3>Ships</h3>
			<p>Players who build a settlement or city on the coast may build 1 ship per turn. Newly built ships are placed on any sea hex adjacent to the player's coastal settlements.</p>
			<p>A ship costs 1 wood and 1 wool</p>
			<p>On a players turn, each ship may perform one action. A ship may not take any action on the same turn it is built. Ship actions include the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Movement. Ships can sail one to three sea hexes per movement. (multiple ships may occupy the same sea hex and ships may sail through sea hexes occupied by another player's ship)</li>
				<li>Attack. Ships can attack another player's ships or coastal settlements if they both occupy the same sea hex. Both players involved roll one die and the higher die wins the battle. If the attacker wins, he may plunder two gold from the loser. If the loser does not have any gold, he may rob one resource from the losers hand at random. If the defender wins, no action is taken. In both cases, the loser must move his ship to an adjacent hex of the winners choosing. A tie must be re-rolled.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Ship benefits. Players who have built ships also may:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Use port trades. Players may use any trade benefits of ports that their ship is adjacent to.</li>
				<li>Build. Players may build a new settlement on any coastal hex that is adjacent to one of their ships (respecting distance rule)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Largest Navy. The first player to build 3 ships receives the Largest Navy card that is worth 2 victory points. Like Largest Army, this may be stolen if another player builds a larger Navy.</p>

		<h3>The Kraken</h3>
			<p>For every 7 sea hexes that ships sail across, the kraken attacks the player with the most victory points. This attack occurs immediately after ship movement. The victim must assign a number to each of his ships and coastal settlements and roll to determine which one is destroyed. Coastal cities are downgraded to settlements. If the victim does not have any ships or coastal settlements, the victim becomes the player with the second most victory points, etc.</p>

		<h3>Knights</h3>
			<p>Before the game begins, remove all knight cards from the dev card deck. During the trade and build phase of a player's turn, he may build 1 knight for 1 ore and 1 wool. Newly built knights are placed on any hex adjacent to the player's settlements.</p>
			<p>On a players turn, each knight may perform one action. A knight may not take any action on the same turn it is built. Knight actions include the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Movement. Knights can move one hex across unsettled territory, or two hexes that are adjacent to roads, per movement. (multiple knights may occupy the same hex and knights may move through hexes occupied by another player's knights)</li>
				<li>Attack. Knights can attack another player's knights or cities and settlements if they both occupy the same hex. Both players involved roll one die and the higher die wins the battle. If the attacker wins, he may plunder two gold from the loser. If the loser does not have any gold, he may rob one resource from the losers hand at random. If the defender wins, no action is taken. In both cases, the loser must move his knight to an adjacent hex of the winners choosing. A tie must be re-rolled.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Knights as robbers. Hexes occupied by a knight do not produce resources for any player except the owner of the knight.</p>
			<p>Largest Army. This rule applies the same as base Catan. The first player to build 3 knights get Largest Army which is worth 2 victory points. Another player may steal if he builds a larger army.</p>

		<h3>Cavalry</h3>
			<p>During the trade and build phase, a player may upgrade a knight to a cavalryman for 2 wheat. Calalvry may move greater distances; 2 hexes across unsettled territory, or up to three hexes adjacent to roads.</p>	
			<p>Cavalry count as 2 knights when counting size of largest army.</p>
			<p>Upgrading a knight counts as an action, and no further action may be accomplished by that cavalry on the same turn.</p>
