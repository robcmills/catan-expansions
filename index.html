		<h1>Conquest âš” v0.91</h1>
			<p>For the glory of your country! New islands have been discovered across the Emerald Sea and you have been ordered by your King to claim the land for your country. However, you are not the only one who hopes to discover riches on foreign soil. Gather your knights and set sail. Conquest is a game of colonization and medieval combat.</p>

		<h3 id="objective">Objective</h3>
			<p>The objective of Conquest is to be the player with the most victory tokens at the end of the game. Victory tokens are claimed in the following ways:</p>
			<p><b>Anytime - Multiple possible</b></p>
			<ol>
				<li><b>Conquer:</b> 1 tokens for each encampment that you sieze from another player. 2 tokens for forts, 3 for castles</li>
				<li><b>Breach:</b> 1 token for each wall breached</li>
				<li><b>Battle:</b> 1 token for each knight you capture or ship you sink.</li>
				<li><b>Rescue:</b> 1 token for each prisoner you free.</li>
				<li><b>Castle:</b> 1 token for each built castle</li>
				<li><b>Empire:</b> 1 token for each encampment built on an island other than starting island. 2 tokens for forts, 3 for castles.</li>
			</ol>

		<p><b>Anytime - Once per game per player</b></p>
			<ol>
				<li><b>Citadel:</b> 1 token per hex for completely enclosing one or more hexes with walls. Note that you do not have to build walls on edges bordering mountain hexes.</li>
				<li><b>Complex:</b> 1 token for building on 3 or more adjacent hexes</li>
				<li><b>Great Wall:</b> 1 token for building a wall of length 5 or more</li>
			</ol>

		<p><b>Once at the end (if a tie exists both players receive tokens)</b></p>
			<ol>
				<li><b>General:</b> 3 tokens for the player with the most prisoners.</li>
				<li><b>Admiral:</b> 3 tokens for the player with the most sunken ships.</li>
				<li><b>Emperor:</b> 3 tokens for the player with the most claimed hexes. Claimed hexes are occupied, developed or enclosed in a Citadel.</li>
			</ol>


		<h3 id="setup">Setup</h3>
			<p>Build the map according to the following diagrams:</p>
			<p>Todo</p>

		<h3 id="starting">Starting Actions</h3>
			<p>
				Each player rolls 2 dice. Highest roll starts first.<br>
				<b>Landfall:</b> The first player begins by landing his ship on any island. Choose any coastal sea hex and place one caravel ship (at no cost).<br>
				<b>Disembark:</b> Then place one infantry knight on any terrain hex adjacent to the ship.<br>
				<b>Camp:</b> Then place an encampment on the hex occupied by the knight.<br>
				Optionally, the knight may execute a movement to another hex and build after the movement.<br>
				This ends the first players turn, and play rotates to the <b>right</b>.<br>
				Each player executes their starting actions in turn.<br>
				When all players have finished their starting actions the player who started last, is the first player to start the game and execute a normal turn.<br>
				Play then proceeds to the <b>left</b>.
			</p>

		<h3 id="gold">Gold ðŸ’°</h3>
			<p>
				Gold is the primary currency of the game. You will use gold to build castles, knights and ships.<br>
				At the beginning of each player's turn he receives 6 gold.<br>
			</p>

		<h3 id="hexes">Hexes</h3>
			<p>The geography of the map is important to consider in developing your military tactics and strategies:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Mountains:</b> Steep, rocky and treacherous, mountain hexes can not be occupied or built on.</li>
				<li><b>Forrest:</b> The dense trees provide excellent cover against archer attacks from range. Archers attacking troops in the forrest must subtract 1 from their attack rolls.<br>
				Forrests are habitat to deer, elk, and other big game. Hunter's are more likely to have successful hunts (roll a 1, 2 or 3).</li>
				<li><b>Plains:</b> The open, rolling grasslands are ideal for horses. Extend cavalry movement +2.<br>
				Plains provide no cover from hails of arrows. Increase archers attack rolls +1.</li>
				<li><b>Desert:</b> Deep sands and hot sun. Hunting may not be performed in desert hexes.</li>
				<li>
					<b>Sea:</b> Sea hexes are where your naval maneuvering and battles will take place.<br>
					<b>Prevailing Wind Direction:</b> The sea hexes beyond the border of the map are in the deep, open ocean, where strong, prevailing winds can greatly enhance a sea-worthy sailor's ability to travel long distances. When ships move out into the deep sea, they may take advantage of the prevailing winds to travel +6 sea hexes in addition to each ship's normal movement range. Though they must travel in the same direction as the prevailing winds, which are either clockwise or counter-clockwise, to be decided by the player who starts last.
				</li>
				<li><b>Reef:</b> Warm, shallow waters and coral attract fish. Ships fishing in reef hexes are more likely to catch fish (roll a 1, 2 or 3)</li>
			</ul>

		<h3 id="occupancy">Maximum Occupancy</h3>
			<p>Each hex on the map may be occupied by only one unit or one development.<br>
			Prisoners do not count toward occupancy.<br>
			<p>Diagram - todo</p>

		<h3 id="units">Combat Units âš”</h3>
			<p>There are two categories of combat units, Knights and Ships, with three types of each:</p>

			<p>Ships:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Caravel:</b> A small, maneuverable sailing ship with lateen sails, capable of basic attacking and defending and the most movement range of all naval units. 6 movement</li>
				<li><b>Galley:</b> Large warship with powerful cannons, but slower and less sea-worthy. (limit 1) 3 movement, +2 attack, +2 defense, 3 attack range* (diminishing accuracy)</li>
				<li><b>Freighter:</b> A large, oar-powered ship primarily for transporting troops. 5 movement, +3 transport, -attack, -defend (limit 3)<br>
					Freighters can transport up to 3 land units of any type.<br>
					Freighters can not attack or defend other ships or coastal buildings, but they can defend themselves like normal ships.
					<p><b>Loading and unloading freighters:</b><br>
						Loading knights onto a freighter is considered 1 movement that counts against each knightâ€™s movement range.<br>
						Archers loaded onto a freighter can attack coastal hexes or enemy ships. The combination of a freighter loaded with 3 archers is a powerful weapon.
					</p>
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Knights:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Infantry:</b> 2 movement</li>
				<li><b>Archer:</b> 1 movement, 3 attack range* (diminishing accuracy)</li>
				<li><b>Cavalry:</b> 3 movement, +2 attack</li>
			</ul>

			<p><b>Building Units:</b>
				On a player's turn he may only build <b>2 knights or 2 ships or 1 knight and 1 ship.</b> (unless he has built a castle, in which case his production capacity increases to 3)<br>
				In order to build a ship, players must have an encampment, fort or castle on the coast.<br>
				Newly built units are placed on any empty hex adjacent to any of the player's developments.
			</p>

			<p><b>Activating Units:</b>
				At the beginning of each round, every player receives 6 activation tokens. Each player, on his turn, may spend activation tokens to activate units and execute actions with those units.<br>
				Activating a unit costs the same as building costs, but must be paid in activation tokens.<br>
				Each activated unit can execute <b>2 actions</b>.<br>
				Once the player has resolved each unit's actions, lay the piece on its side to denote that it has completed its actions. At the end of the turn, reset all units to their upright position.<br>
				Each action must be unique. A player may not move the same ship twice or attack with the same ship twice.<br>
				Activation and subsequent actions can occur at any point in a player's turn, but once a unit is activated the player must execute both its actions immediately or execute one and forfeit the other. The one exception to this rule is embarking and disembarking from a freighter.
			</p>

			<p><b>Unit Actions:</b></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Movement</li>
				<li>Attack</li>
				<li>Breach</li>
				<li>Fish/Hunt</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				<b>Movement:</b> Players may move units through hexes occupied by their own units, but must respect maximum occupancy rule, and only end movement in an empty hex.<br>
				During the build phase, units may pass through or occupy hexes occupied by another player. However during the attack phase, movement into a hex occupied by another player necessitates a battle.<br>
				If two units owned by different players occupy the same hex at the start of the battle round, the first owner to execute his turn must either move the unit or initiate an attack.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Attack:</b> There are 2 types of attack:<br>
				<ol>
					<li><b>Adjacent:</b><br>
					Units can attack another player if they occupy an adjacent hex.<br>
					To resolve an adjacent attack, both players involved roll one die and the higher die (after applying any eligible modifiers) wins the battle. A tie must be re-rolled.
					</li>
					<li><b>Ranged:</b><br>
					Archers, Artillery and Galleys are capable of ranged attacks.<br>
					To resolve a ranged attack, the attacker rolls one die. If the result is 1, 2 or 3 (after applying any eligible modifiers) the attack is successful.
					</li>
				</ol>
			</p>

			<p>
				<b>Ranged Attack Modifiers:</b>
				Ranged attacks' accuracy decreases with range. For attacks at range 2, only a die roll of 1 or 2 scores a hit. At range 3, only a 1 scores a hit.<br>
				For terrain advantage modifiers, namely +1 attack for no cover, simply add one more number as a successful hit. For example, an archer attack aimed at a plains hex at range 1 (adjacent) would be successful on a die roll of 1, 2, 3, or 4.<br>
			</p>

			<p>
				<b>Artillery:</b>
				Artillery units must be fired by a knight on the same hex.<br>
				Firing artillery expends the knight's attack action.<br>
				Artillery can be moved by any knight, up to the same movement range as the unit.
			</p>

			<p>
				<b>Results of an attack:</b>
				If the defender wins no action is taken (advantage to attacker)<br>
				When a knight is defeated in battle the victor captures him and places the piece on his nearest developed hex. This knight is considered a prisoner. Prisoners are counted toward the General Victory Token condition.<br>
				<b>Rescue:</b> If an opponent manages to seize a developed hex with prisoners on it, prisoners belonging to him are immediately freed and can now take actions. Any prisoners belonging to other players become the prisoners of the hex's new owner.<br>
				When a ship is defeated in battle the victor sinks the loser's ship, removes it from the board, and places it in an area near him designated as his ship graveyard. Sunken ships are counted toward the Admiral Victory Token condition.<br>
			</p>

			<p>
				<b>Breaching a Wall</b> see <a href="#walls">Walls</a> section below
			</p>

			<p>
				<b>Hunting and Fishing</b> Roll one die and if the result is 1, collect 1 meat/fish. If the result is a 2, collect 2 meat/fish. 2 meat/fish may be exchanged for 1 gold.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				<b>Additional Unit Actions:</b> The following actions may be performed by knights and ships and do not count towards each units 2 action limit:
				<ul>
					<li><b>Defend:</b> Units may defend other units or developments if they are located on a hex adjacent to both the attacker and the unit they are defending. See diagram.</li>
					<li><b>Build:</b> Players may build on any hex that is adjacent to one of their units. Building does not count as an action, however a player can not interrupt a unit's movement to build. Building must occur before or after a unit's movement. Also building may not occur during a player's <a href="#retaliation">Retaliation</a></li>
					<li><b>Seize:</b> If a player moves any of their units to a hex adjacent to an enemy development, then that development is considered "under seige". If any of the defending player's units are defending the development (adjacent to both the development and the attacker), the attacking player must first defeat them before seizing control of the development. If no defending units are present, the attacker may immediately seize control of the development by removing it from the board and replacing it with an equivalent development of their color.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>

		<h3 id="retaliation">Retaliation</h3>
			<p>Especially when playing with 4 or more players, turn order can become over-powered, with the last player being defenseless while 5 other players get a chance to attack him. The activation tokens budget is meant to mitigate this, but Retaliation is meant to solve it.<br>
			When a player is attacked by the active player, and loses a battle, he may then Retaliate.<br>
			Retaliation occurs immediately after the active player wins a battle with an activated unit, and has expended all that unit's actions.<br>
			Then the player who lost the battle receives 1 activation token, and may activate 1 unit of his choice (provided he can afford the activation cost), and execute 2 actions with that unit.<br>
			The only restriction is that the retaliating player may not build during retaliation.<br>
			Battles won by a retaliating player do not trigger additional retaliations.
			</p>

		<h3 id="tactics">Tactics</h3>
			<p><b>Flanking:</b> The attacker receives +2 advantage for attacking from a flank, +4 for attacking from a rear flank, and +6 for attacking from the rear.</p>
			<p><b>Surrender:</b> If the attacker is able to surround a hex (attack from all exposed directions) the defender must immediately surrender and all units are captured</p>

		<h3 id="artillery">Artillery</h3>
			<p>Artillery are basically cannons mounted on small chariots. Artillery require a knight on the same hex to be used (as an action).<br>
			Artillery can be moved by any knight.<br>
			Note that although artillery are an extremely powerful weapon, they are a double edged sword because an opponent can seize your artillery and then use it against you. If an opponent defeats all knights on the hex where an artillery is located, he may occupy the hex and use the artillery for himself.</p>

		<h3 id="walls">Walls</h3>
			<p>Walls are a great way to defend yourself from attack, however they are not guaranteed to protect you.</p>
			<p>Walls may be built on any edge of a player's occupied or built hexes</p>
      <p>Once per a player's turn, he may deconstruct an existing wall and rebuild it in a new location at no cost</p>
      <p>Knights may not attack or move through opponent walls, however a player's own knights may move freely or attack through his own walls</p>
      <p><b>Breaching a Wall</b>
	      <ul>
		      <li>Players may attempt to breach an opponent's wall if he has a knight occupying an adjacent hex.</li>
		      <li>To breach, roll one die and if the result is a 5 or 6, the breach is succesful</li>
		      <li>Upon successful breach of a wall, it is removed from the board and the player may then attack the newly exposed hex.</li>
		      <li>Breaching counts as a knight action.</li>
		      <li>Breaching may be attempted more than once if the player has more than one knight on adjacent hexes who have not exhausted their actions.</li>
		      <li>Ships may attempt to breach coastal walls</li>
		    </ul>
		   </p>

		<h3 id="castles">Castles</h3>
			<p>Players who have built a castle may increase their production of combat units to 3 per turn.</p>

		<h3 id="phases">Game Phases</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Phase 1 - Build:</b>	During this phase no attack actions are allowed.</li>
				<li><b>Phase 2 - Battle:</b> During this phase attack actions are allowed and turn order is modified:
					<p><b>Battle phase turn order:</b> At the start of each round, recalculate each player's points. The player with the least points goes first, highest last.</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Each phase lasts 3 rounds. Implement a counter to keep track.</p>

		<h3 id="points">Points</h3>
			<p>Points are used during the game, but do not determine the winner. Points are the same as building costs.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Building: 2 points per artillery, 1 point per wall, 1 per encampment, 2 per fort, 3 per castle</li>
				<li>Armies: 1 point per infantry, 2 per archer, 3 per cavalry</li>
				<li>Navies: 1 point per caravel, 2 per freighter, 3 per galley</li>
			</ul>
