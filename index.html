		<h1>Catan Expansions üåÖ</h1> 
			<p>This is a collection of expansions to the game of Catan. All rules of the base game apply with the following new rules:</p>

		<h3>Gold üí∞</h3>
			<p>Gold hexes are added to the board and operate much the same as they do in the Explorers and Pirates Expansion:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Gold hexes produce one gold each time their resource number is rolled during a production round</li>
				<li>2 gold may be traded to the bank for any 1 resource</li>
				<li>Gold may be traded with other players</li>
			</ul>

		<h3>The Dragon üêâ</h3>
			<p>For every 7 gold that is produced by gold hexes, the dragon attacks the player with the most victory points. This attack occurs immediately after resource production roll. The victim of the dragon attack must assign a number to each of his settlements and cities and roll a die to determine which one is attacked. A settlement attacked by the dragon is completely destroyed and removed from the board. If more than once player is tied for most victory points, include gold in the count.</p>
			<p>If you are playing with no robber (described below)(recommended) then never count gold chosen during a 7 production roll (year of plenty for all) towards the dragon attack counter.</p>
			<p>If you are playing with phases (described below) then during the first phase (Build) do not advance the dragon gold counter. It only takes effect during phase 2 and 3.</p>

		<h3>Ships ‚õµ</h3>
			<p>Players who have built a settlement or city on the coast may build <b>1 ship per turn</b></p>
			<p>A ship costs 1 wood and 1 wool</p>
			<p>Newly built ships are placed on any sea hex adjacent to any of the player's coastal settlements.</p>
			<p>On a players turn, each ship may perform <b>one action</b>. A ship may not take any action on the same turn it is built. Ship actions include the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Movement</b> Ships can sail <b>1 to four</b> sea hexes per movement. (Multiple ships may occupy the same sea hex and ships may sail through sea hexes occupied by another player's ship)</li>
				<li><b>Attack</b> Ships can attack another player's ships or coastal settlements if they both occupy the same sea hex. Both players involved roll one die and the higher die wins the battle. If attacking a settlement, defender wins a tie. If attacking a city, defender adds 1 to his roll. A tie must be re-rolled. The results of an attack:
					<ul>
						<li>If ship to ship attack, victor destroys loser's ship and removes it from the board</li>
						<li>If ship to coastal settlement attack (no defending ships - see below), victor occupies loser's settlement (removes it from the board and replaces it with his own)</li>
						<li>If the defender wins no action is taken (advantage to attacker)</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p><b>Ship benefits:</b> Players who have built ships also may:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Defend</b> When a ship is attacking a coastal settlement, if the defender has a ship on an adjacent sea hex, that ship is defending that coastal settlement, and the attacker must first attack the defending ship before attacking the coastal settlement</li>
				<li><b>Use port trades</b> Players may use any trade benefits of ports that their ship is adjacent to</li>
				<li><b>Build</b> Players may build a new settlement (or knight if playing with knight module) on any coastal hex that is adjacent to one of their ships (respecting distance rule)</li>
				<li><b>Resource production ?</b> Players may collect one resource per ship if the number for a production roll matches a resource hex adjacent to any of their ships</li>
				<li><b>Largest Navy</b> The first player to build 3 ships receives the Largest Navy card that is worth 2 victory points. Like Largest Army, this may be stolen if another player builds a larger Navy.</li>
			</ul>

		<h3>The Kraken üêô</h3>
			<p>For every 7 sea hexes that ships sail across, the kraken attacks the player with the most victory points. This attack occurs immediately after ship movement. The victim must assign a number to each of his ships and coastal settlements and roll to determine which one is destroyed. If the victim does not have any ships or coastal settlements, the victim becomes the player with the second most victory points, etc.</p>

		<h3>Knights</h3>
			<p>Before the game begins, remove all knight cards from the dev card deck. During the trade and build phase of a player's turn, he may build <b>1 knight</b> per turn</p>
			<p>Building a knight costs 1 ore and 1 wool</p>
			<p>Newly built knights are placed on any hex adjacent to any of the player's settlements</p>
			<p>On a players turn, each knight may perform <b>one action.</b> A knight may not take any action on the same turn it is built. Knight actions include the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Movement</b> Knights can move <b>1 hex</b> across unsettled territory, or <b>two hexes</b> that are adjacent to roads, per movement (multiple knights may occupy the same hex and knights may move through hexes occupied by another player's knights)</li>
				<li><b>Attack</b> Knights can attack another player's knights or settlements if they both occupy the same hex. Both players involved roll one die and the higher die wins the battle. If attacking a settlement, defender wins a tie. If attacking a city, defender adds 1 to his roll. A tie must be re-rolled. The results of an attack:
					<ul>
						<li>If knight to knight attack, victor kills loser's knight and removes it from the board</li>
						<li>If knight to settlement attack (no defending knights - see below), victor occupies loser's settlement (removes it from the board and replaces it with his own)</li>
						<li>If the defender wins no action is taken (advantage to attacker)</li>
					</ul>
				</li>

			</ul>
			<p><b>Knight benefits:</b> Players who have built knights also may:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Defend</b> When a knight is attacking a settlement, if the defender has a knight on an adjacent hex, that knight is defending that settlement, and the attacker must first attack the defending knight before attacking the settlement</li>
				<li><b>Build</b> Players may build a new settlement (or ship if playing with ship module) on any hex that is occupied by one of their knights (respecting distance rule)</li>
				<li><b>Largest Army</b> This rule applies the same as base Catan. The first player to build 3 knights get Largest Army which is worth 2 victory points. Another player may steal if he builds a larger army.</li>
			</ul>

		<h3>No Robber</h3>
			<p>The robber is removed from the game entirely. If a 7 is rolled for resource production, this results in a modified "year of plenty" for all players (except during Attack phase - described below). Each player may collect 1 resource per settlement and 1 resource per city they have built. Players may choose which resource to collect from the adjacent resources to each settlement/city.</p>	
			<p>There is no penalty for having more than 7 cards at any time</p>

		<h3>Game Phases</h3>
			<p>If you play with knights and ships and elect to grant them destructive powers, this can greatly lengthen the game. To remedy this, and also to keep the game to a reasonable length, you may elect to play the game with three phases:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Phase 1 - Build:</b>	During this phase, players may only build roads, settlements and cities. No knights or ships may be built. Any gold produced does not count toward dragon attacks.</li>
				<li><b>Phase 2 - Cold War:</b>	During this phase players may begin building ships and knights and move already built ships and knights. No attack actions are allowed.</li>
				<li><b>Phase 3 - Attack:</b> During this phase attack actions are allowed. If playing with no robber, 7 resource rolls must be re-rolled during this phase.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Each phase lasts three rounds of turns. Implement a counter to keep track. At the end of the 9th round, the player with the most victory points wins</p>
