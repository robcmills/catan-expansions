		<h3 id="objective">Objective</h3>
			<p>The objective of Conquest is to be the player with the most victory tokens at the end of the game. Victory tokens are claimed in the following ways:</p>
			<p><b>Anytime - Multiple possible</b></p>
			<ol>
				<li><b>Conquer:</b> 1 tokens for each encampment that you sieze from another player. 2 tokens for forts, 3 for castles</li>
				<li><b>Breach:</b> 1 token for each wall breached</li>
				<li><b>Battle:</b> 1 token for each knight you capture or ship you sink.</li>
				<li><b>Rescue:</b> 1 token for each prisoner you free.</li>
				<li><b>Castle:</b> 1 token for each built castle</li>
				<li><b>Empire:</b> 1 token for each encampment built on an island other than starting island. 2 tokens for forts, 3 for castles.</li>
			</ol>

		<p><b>Anytime - Once per game per player</b></p>
			<ol>
				<li><b>Citadel:</b> 1 token per hex for completely enclosing one or more hexes with walls. Note that you do not have to build walls on edges bordering mountain hexes.</li>
				<li><b>Complex:</b> 1 token for building on 3 or more adjacent hexes</li>
				<li><b>Great Wall:</b> 1 token for building a wall of length 5 or more</li>
			</ol>

		<p><b>Once at the end (if a tie exists both players receive tokens)</b></p>
			<ol>
				<li><b>General:</b> 3 tokens for the player with the most prisoners.</li>
				<li><b>Admiral:</b> 3 tokens for the player with the most sunken ships.</li>
				<li><b>Emperor:</b> 3 tokens for the player with the most claimed hexes. Claimed hexes are occupied, developed or enclosed in a Citadel.</li>
			</ol>

		<h3 id="setup">Setup</h3>
			<ol>
				<li><b>Build the Map:</b><br>
					The size and geography of the map have a great effect on the game experience. Players are encouraged to be creative, and build the map however they like. However the following are some guidelines that help ensure an even distribution and balanced layout, as well as some recommended examples for new players.<br>
					<b>Random Setup:</b>
					<ol>
						<li>Build the frame according to the number of players. See diagrams.</li>
						<li>
							Gather the correct number of each hex type.<br>
							<b>2 players:</b>  3 deserts, 9 forrests, 9 mountains, 18 plains, 6 reefs, 16 sea hexes<br>
							<b>4 players:</b> 154 hexes total
						</li>
						<li>Shuffle all the hexes face down</li>
						<li>Beginning at one corner of the map, begin drawing random hexes and turning them over to reveal them and place them along the outer-most edge of the map.</li>
						<li>If a revealed hex is a sea hex, place the next hex inwards toward the center of the map. If the next hex is terrain, continue placing along the outer edge, but if another sea hex is drawn, continue placing inwards toward the center.<li>
						<li>If a mountain, forrest, desert or reef hex is drawn and is to be placed adjacent to a hex of the same type, put that hex aside and draw another until you get a different type of hex. Then place the hexes that were set aside.</li>
						<li>Repeat this pattern until the outer ring has been filled and then continue on to building inner rings until the map is filled.</li>
						<li>You may want to make a few adjustments if key hexes get clumped together in the same area of the map. Especially forrests and reefs and mountains should be relatively evenly distributed across the map. Feel free to swap a few hexes until it looks balanced.</li>
					</ol>

				<li><b>Starting Units:</b> Each player begins the game with the following units:<br>
					3 soldiers, 2 archers, 1 cavalry<br>
					3 caravels, 2 freighters, 1 galleon<br>
					Each player must load his 2 freighters with 3 land units each.
				</li>

				<li><b>Prevailing Winds:</b> Determine the direction of prevailing by flipping the Prevailing Winds Token. Place it in the center of the map.</li>

				<li><b>Placement:</b>
					Each player in turn sequentially places one of any of his ships on any sea hex, until all players have placed all units.<br>
					Placement Restrictions:
					<ul>
						<li>Placing on a hex already occupied by another player is prohibited.</li>
						<li>Placing on a land hex is prohibited. All land units remain loaded on the freighters.</li>
						<li>Placing respects maximum occupancy rule. No more than 3 units may occupy the same hex.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>

				<li>You are now ready to begin the game. Begin the first round of the Build Phase.</li>
			</ol>

		<h3 id="phases">Game Phases</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Phase 1 - Build:</b>	Players may build developments, additional units, and maneuver units around the map. No attack actions are allowed.</li>
				<li><b>Phase 2 - Battle:</b> Attack actions are allowed. Players may continue building and turn order is modified:
					<p><b>Battle phase turn order:</b> At the start of each round, recalculate each player's points. The player with the least points goes first, highest last.</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Each phase lasts 2 rounds.</p>

		<h3 id="points">Points</h3>
			<p>Points are used during the game, but do not determine the winner. Points are the same as building costs.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Building: 2 points per artillery, 1 point per wall, 1 per encampment, 2 per fort, 3 per castle</li>
				<li>Armies: 1 point per infantry, 2 per archer, 3 per cavalry</li>
				<li>Navies: 1 point per caravel, 2 per freighter, 3 per galleon</li>
			</ul>

		<h3 id="gold">Gold</h3>
			<p>
				At the beginning of each player's turn he receives 6 gold.<br>
				Gold is used to build developments, combat units, walls and artillery.
			</p>

		<h3 id="silver">Silver</h3>
			<p>
				At the beginning of each player's turn he receives 6 silver.<br>
				Silver is used to activate units.
			</p>

		<h3 id="hexes">Hexes</h3>
			<p>The geography of the map is important to consider in developing your military tactics and strategies:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Mountains:</b> Steep, rocky and treacherous, mountain hexes can not be occupied or built on.</li>
				<li><b>Forrest:</b> The dense trees provide excellent cover against archer attacks from range. Archers attacking troops in the forrest must subtract 1 from their attack rolls.
				</li>
				<li><b>Plains:</b> The open, rolling grasslands are ideal for horses. Extend cavalry movement +1.<br>
				Plains provide no cover from hails of arrows. Increase archers attack rolls +1.</li>
				<li><b>Desert:</b> Deep sands and a hot sun makes travel difficult. Reduce movement range -1.</li>
				<li><b>Sea:</b> Sea hexes are where your naval maneuvering and battles will take place.<br>
					<b>Prevailing Wind Direction:</b> The sea hexes beyond the border of the map are in the deep, open ocean, where strong, prevailing winds can greatly enhance a sea-worthy sailor's ability to travel long distances. When ships move out into the deep sea, they may take advantage of the prevailing winds to travel from one edge of the map to the next adjacent edge in addition to each ship's normal movement range. Player's ships may enter the prevailing winds from any border hex, and exit into any border hex on the next edge of the map. Though they must travel in the same direction as the prevailing winds, which are either clockwise or counter-clockwise around the map. See diagram.<br>
					Ships may not end their movement in the deep ocean. Ships must use 1 movement to enter prevailing winds and 1 movement to exit. If a ship does not have 2 spare movements it may not use prevailing winds.
				</li>
				<li><b>Reef:</b> Shallow waters and dangerous rocks. Ships passing through reef hexes must proceed slowly and with caution. Reduce movement range -1.</li>
			</ul>

		<h3 id="occupancy">Maximum Occupancy</h3>
			<p>Each hex on the map may be occupied by only 3 or less units. Encampments count as 1 unit towards a hex's occupancy. Forts count 2 and castles count 3.<br>
			Prisoners do not count toward occupancy.<br>

		<h3 id="units">Combat Units ⚔</h3>
			<p>There are two categories of combat units, Knights and Ships, with three types of each:</p>

			<p>Ships:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Caravel:</b> A small, maneuverable sailing ship with lateen sails, capable of basic attacking and defending and the most movement range of all naval units. 6 movement</li>
				<li><b>Galley:</b> Large warship with powerful cannons, but slower and less sea-worthy. (limit 1) 3 movement, +1 attack, +2 defense, 3 attack range* (diminishing accuracy)</li>
				<li><b>Freighter:</b> A large, oar-powered ship primarily for transporting troops. 5 movement, +3 transport, -attack, -defend (limit 3)<br>
					Freighters can transport up to 3 land units of any type.<br>
					Freighters can not attack or defend other ships or coastal buildings, but they can defend themselves like normal ships.
					<p><b>Loading and unloading freighters:</b><br>
						Loading knights onto a freighter is considered 1 movement that counts against each knight’s movement range.<br>
						Archers loaded onto a freighter can attack coastal hexes or enemy ships. The combination of a freighter loaded with 3 archers is a powerful weapon.
					</p>
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Knights:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Infantry:</b> 2 movement</li>
				<li><b>Archer:</b> 1 movement, 3 attack range* (diminishing accuracy)</li>
				<li><b>Cavalry:</b> 3 movement, +2 attack</li>
			</ul>

			<p><b>Building Units:</b>
				At the beginning of each round, every player receives 6 gold.<b>
				On a player's turn he may only build <b>2 knights or 2 ships or 1 knight and 1 ship.</b> (unless he has built a castle, in which case his production capacity increases to 3)<br>
				Built land units are placed on any developed hex.<br>
				Built ships are placed on any sea hex adjacent to a player's coastal development (in order to build ships, players must have an encampment, fort or castle on the coast)<br>
				Building units must respect maximum occupancy rule.
			</p>

			<p><b>Activating Units:</b>
				At the beginning of each round, every player receives 6 silver.<b>
				Each player, on his turn, may spend silver to activate units and execute actions with those units.<br>
				Activating a unit costs the same as building costs, but must be paid in silver.<br>
				Each activated unit can execute <b>3 actions</b>.<br>
				Once the player has resolved each unit's actions, lay the piece on its side to denote that it has completed its actions. At the end of the turn, reset all units to their upright position.<br>
				Each action must be unique. A player may not move the same ship twice or attack with the same ship twice.<br>
				Activation and subsequent actions can occur at any point in a player's turn, but once a unit is activated the player must execute all its actions immediately or execute some and forfeit the others. The one exception to this rule is embarking and disembarking from a freighter.
			</p>

			<p><b>Unit Actions:</b></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Movement</li>
				<li>Attack</li>
				<li>Breach</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				<b>Movement:</b> Players may move units through hexes occupied by their own units, but must respect maximum occupancy rule, and only end movement in an eligible hex.<br>
				During the build phase, units may pass through but must not end their movement in hexes occupied by another player.<br>
				During the attack phase, movement into a hex occupied by another player is allowed, but necessitates a battle.<br>
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Attack:</b> There are 2 types of attack:<br>
				<ol>
					<li><b>Adjacent:</b><br>
					Units can attack another player if they occupy an adjacent hex.<br>
					To resolve an adjacent attack, both players involved roll one die and the higher die (after applying any eligible modifiers) wins the battle. A tie must be re-rolled.
					</li>
					<li><b>Ranged:</b><br>
					Archers, Artillery and Galleys are capable of ranged attacks.<br>
					To resolve a ranged attack, the attacker rolls one die. If the result is 1, 2 or 3 (after applying any eligible modifiers) the attack is successful.
					</li>
				</ol>
			</p>

			<p>
				<b>Ranged Attack Modifiers:</b>
				Ranged attacks' accuracy decreases with range. For attacks at range 2, only a die roll of 1 or 2 scores a hit. At range 3, only a 1 scores a hit.<br>
				For terrain advantage modifiers, namely +1 attack for no cover, simply add one more number as a successful hit. For example, an archer attack aimed at a plains hex at range 1 (adjacent) would be successful on a die roll of 1, 2, 3, or 4.<br>
			</p>

			<p>
				<b>Artillery:</b>
				Artillery units must be fired by a knight on the same hex.<br>
				Firing artillery expends the knight's attack action.<br>
				Artillery can be moved by any knight, up to the same movement range as the unit.
			</p>

			<p>
				<b>Results of an attack:</b>
				<b>Retreat:</b> If the defender wins, the attacker must retreat his unit to the hex on which it began its movement.<br>
				<b>Land Victory:</b> If the attacker wins a land battle, the defeated unit is captured. Place the piece on the victor's nearest developed hex. This knight is now considered a prisoner.<br>
				<b>Rescue:</b> If an opponent manages to seize a developed hex with prisoners on it, prisoners belonging to him are immediately freed and can now take actions. Any prisoners belonging to other players become the prisoners of the hex's new owner.<br>
				<b>Sea Victory:</b> If the attacker wins at sea, the victor sinks the loser's ship. Remove it from the board, and places it in an area near him designated as his ship graveyard.<br>
			</p>

			<p>
				<b>Breaching a Wall</b> see <a href="#walls">Walls</a> section below
			</p>

			<p>
				<b>Additional Unit Actions:</b> The following actions may be performed by knights and ships and do not count towards each units 2 action limit:
				<ul>
					<li><b>Defend:</b> Units may defend other units or developments if they are located on a hex adjacent to both the attacker and the unit they are defending. See diagram.</li>
					<li><b>Build:</b> Players may build on any hex that is adjacent to one of their units. Building does not count as an action, however a player can not interrupt a unit's movement to build. Building must occur before or after a unit's movement. Also building may not occur during a player's <a href="#retaliation">Retaliation</a></li>
					<li><b>Seize:</b> If a player moves any of their units to a hex adjacent to an enemy development, then that development is considered "under seige". If any of the defending player's units are defending the development (adjacent to both the development and the attacker), the attacking player must first defeat them before seizing control of the development. If no defending units are present, the attacker may immediately seize control of the development by removing it from the board and replacing it with an equivalent development of their color.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>

		<h3 id="retaliation">Retaliation</h3>
			<p>Especially when playing with 4 or more players, turn order can become over-powered, with the last player being defenseless while 5 other players get a chance to attack him. The silver activation tokens budget is meant to mitigate this, but Retaliation is meant to solve it.<br>
			When a player is attacked by the active player, and loses a battle, he may then Retaliate.<br>
			Retaliation occurs immediately after the active player wins a battle with an activated unit, and has expended all that unit's actions.<br>
			Then the player who lost the battle receives 1 silver token, and may activate 1 unit of his choice (provided he can afford the activation cost), and execute actions with that unit.<br>
			The only restriction is that the retaliating player may not build during retaliation.<br>
			Battles won by a retaliating player do not trigger additional retaliations.
			</p>

		<h3 id="tactics">Tactics</h3>
			<p><b>Flanking:</b> The attacker receives +2 advantage for attacking from a flank, +4 for attacking from a rear flank, and +6 for attacking from the rear. See diagram.</p>
			<p><b>Surrender:</b> If a player is able to surround enemy units, and cut off all escape routes, then the defender must immediately surrender and all units are captured.<br>
			Ships must be surrounded on all adjacent sea hexes as well as any adjacent land hexes. Coastal hexes are considered an escape route. See diagram.
			</p>

		<h3 id="artillery">Artillery</h3>
			<p>Artillery are basically cannons mounted on small chariots. Artillery require a knight on the same hex to be used (as an action).<br>
			Artillery can be moved by any knight.<br>
			Note that although artillery are an extremely powerful weapon, they are a double edged sword because an opponent can seize your artillery and then use it against you. If an opponent defeats all knights on the hex where an artillery is located, he may occupy the hex and use the artillery for himself.</p>

		<h3 id="walls">Walls</h3>
			<p>Walls are a great way to defend yourself from attack, however they are not guaranteed to protect you.</p>
			<p>Walls may be built on any edge of a player's occupied or built hexes</p>
      <p>Once per a player's turn, he may deconstruct an existing wall and rebuild it in a new location at no cost</p>
      <p>Knights may not attack or move through opponent walls, however a player's own knights may move freely or attack through his own walls</p>
      <p><b>Breaching a Wall</b>
	      <ul>
		      <li>Players may attempt to breach an opponent's wall if he has a knight occupying an adjacent hex.</li>
		      <li>To breach, roll a number of dice equal to the unit's cost. If the result of any die is a 1, 2 or 3 the breach is successful</li>
		      <li>Upon successful breach of a wall, it is removed from the board and the player may then attack the newly exposed hex.</li>
		      <li>Breaching counts as a knight action.</li>
		      <li>Breaching may be attempted more than once if the player has more than one knight on adjacent hexes who have not exhausted their actions.</li>
		      <li>Ships may attempt to breach coastal walls</li>
		    </ul>
		   </p>

		<h3 id="castles">Castles</h3>
			<p>Players who have built a castle may increase their production of combat units to 3 per turn.</p>
