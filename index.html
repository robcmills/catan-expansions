		<h1>Catan Expansions üåÖ</h1> 
			<p>This is a collection of expansions to the game of Catan. All rules of the base game apply with the following new rules:</p>

		<h3>Accelerated Start</h3>
			<p>First placement is settlement, second city. Then draw 1 resource for each hex adjacent to settlement and 2 resources for each hex adjacent to city.</p>	

		<h3>Gold üí∞</h3>
			<p>Gold hexes are added to the board and operate much the same as they do in the Explorers and Pirates Expansion:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Gold hexes produce gold each time their resource number is rolled during a production round</li>
				<li>2 gold may be traded to the bank for any 1 resource</li>
				<li>Gold may be traded with other players</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Gold hexes replace wheat, sheep and wood (4 player game) resulting in a balanced 3 hexes per resource plus 1 desert board configuration</p>
			<p>Monopoly card can not be used for gold</p>

		<h3>The Dragon üêâ</h3>
			<p>For every 7 gold that is produced by gold hexes, the dragon attacks the player with the most victory points. This attack occurs immediately after resource production roll. The victim of the dragon attack must assign a number to each of his settlements and cities and roll a die to determine which one is attacked. A settlement attacked by the dragon is completely destroyed and removed from the board. If more than once player is tied for most victory points, include gold in the count.</p>
			<p>If you are playing with no robber (described below)(recommended) then never count gold chosen during a 7 production roll (year of plenty for all) towards the dragon attack counter.</p>
			<p>If you are playing with phases (described below) then during the first phase (Build) do not advance the dragon gold counter. It only takes effect during phase 2 and 3.</p>

		<h3>Ships ‚õµ</h3>
			<p>Players who have built a settlement or city on the coast may build <b>1 ship per turn</b></p>
			<p>If playing with knights, players may build 2 knights or 2 ships or 1 knight and 1 ship per turn</p>
			<p>A ship costs 1 wood and 1 wool</p>
			<p>Newly built ships are placed on any sea hex adjacent to any of the player's coastal settlements. Ships occupy the center of sea hexes, not corners like settlements do. Place them as you would resource number tokens.</p>
			<p>On a players turn, each ship may perform <b>2 actions.</b></p>
			<p>Building a ship is considered an action, so a player may build and move, or build and attack (if in attack phase) but may not build, move, and attack with the same ship on the same turn.</p>
			<p>Each action must be unique. A player may not move the same ship twice or attack with the same ship twice.</p>
			<p>Ship actions can occur at any point in a player's turn. For example, at the beginning of a player's turn, he may move his ship to a nearby port, and then use that port before building.</p>
			<p>Ship actions include the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Movement:</b> Ships can sail <b>up to 4</b> sea hexes per movement. (Multiple ships may occupy the same sea hex and ships may sail through sea hexes occupied by another player's ship)</li>
				<li><b>Attack:</b> Ships can attack another player's ships or coastal settlements if they both occupy the same sea hex. Both players involved roll one die and the higher die wins the battle. If attacking a settlement, defender wins a tie. If attacking a city, defender adds 1 to his roll. A tie must be re-rolled. The results of an attack:
					<ul>
						<li>If ship to ship attack, victor destroys loser's ship and removes it from the board</li>
						<li>If ship to coastal settlement attack (no defending ships - see below), victor occupies loser's settlement (removes it from the board and replaces it with his own)</li>
						<li>If the defender wins no action is taken (advantage to attacker)</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p><b>Ship benefits:</b> Players who have built ships also may:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Defend:</b> When a ship is attacking a coastal settlement, if the defender has a ship on an adjacent sea hex, that ship is defending that coastal settlement, and the attacker must first attack the defending ship before attacking the coastal settlement. During attack phase, a newly built ship may defend on the same turn. Ships can not defend coastal settlements from knight attacks. Defending does not count as an action.</li>
				<li><b>Use port trades:</b> Players may use any trade benefits of ports that their ship is adjacent to</li>
				<li><b>Build:</b> Players may build a new settlement (or knight if playing with knight module) on any coastal hex that is adjacent to one of their ships (respecting distance rule)</li>
				<li><b>Largest Navy:</b> The first player to build 3 ships receives the Largest Navy card that is worth 2 victory points. Like Largest Army, this may be stolen if another player builds a larger Navy.</li>
			</ul>

		<h3>Knights</h3>
			<p>Before the game begins, remove all knight cards from the dev card deck. During the trade and build phase of a player's turn, he may build <b>1 knight</b> per turn</p>
			<p>If playing with ships, players may build 2 knights or 2 ships or 1 knight and 1 ship per turn</p>
			<p>Building a knight costs 1 ore and 1 wool</p>
			<p>Newly built ships are placed on any hex adjacent to any of the player's settlements. Knights occupy the center of hexes, not corners like settlements do. Place them as you would resource number tokens.</p>
			<p>On a players turn, each knight may perform <b>2 actions</b></p>
			<p>Building a knight is considered an action, so a player may build and move, or build and attack (if in attack phase) but may not build, move, and attack with the same knight on the same turn.</p>
			<p>Each action must be unique. A player may not move the same knight twice or attack with the same knight twice.</p>
			<p>Knight actions can occur at any point in a player's turn. For example, at the beginning of a player's turn, he may move his knight to a nearby hex, and then build a settlement there (respecting distance rule).</p>
			<p>Knight actions include the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Movement</b> Knights can move <b>1 hex</b> across unsettled territory, or <b>two hexes</b> that are adjacent to roads, per movement (multiple knights may occupy the same hex and knights may move through hexes occupied by another player's knights)</li>
				<li><b>Attack</b> Knights can attack another player's knights or settlements if they both occupy the same hex. Both players involved roll one die and the higher die wins the battle. If attacking a settlement, defender wins a tie. If attacking a city, defender adds 1 to his roll. A tie must be re-rolled. The results of an attack:
					<ul>
						<li>If knight to knight attack, victor kills loser's knight and removes it from the board</li>
						<li>If knight to settlement attack (no defending knights - see below), victor occupies loser's settlement (removes it from the board and replaces it with his own)</li>
						<li>If the defender wins no action is taken (advantage to attacker)</li>
					</ul>
				</li>

			</ul>
			<p><b>Knight benefits:</b> Players who have built knights also may:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Defend:</b> When a knight is attacking a settlement, if the defender has a knight on an adjacent hex, that knight is defending that settlement, and the attacker must first attack the defending knight before attacking the settlement. During attack phase, a newly built knight may defend on the same turn. Knights can not defend a settlement from a ship attack. Defending does not count as an action.</li>
				<li><b>Build:</b> Players may build a new settlement (or ship if playing with ship module) on any hex that is occupied by one of their knights (respecting distance rule)</li>
				<li><b>Largest Army:</b> This rule applies the same as base Catan. The first player to build 3 knights get Largest Army which is worth 2 victory points. Another player may steal if he builds a larger army.</li>
			</ul>

		<h3>No Robber</h3>
			<p>The robber is removed from the game entirely. If a 7 is rolled for resource production, this results in a modified "year of plenty" for all players (except during Attack phase - described below). Each player may collect 1 resource per settlement and 1 resource per city they have built. Players may choose which resource to collect from the adjacent resources to each settlement/city.</p>	
			<p>There is no penalty for having more than 7 cards at any time</p>

		<h3>Game Phases</h3>
			<p>If you play with knights and ships and elect to grant them destructive powers, this can greatly lengthen the game. To remedy this, and also to keep the game to a reasonable length, you may elect to play the game with three phases:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Phase 1 - Build:</b>	During this phase, players may only build roads, settlements and cities. No knights or ships may be built. Any gold produced does not count toward dragon attacks.</li>
				<li><b>Phase 2 - Cold War:</b>	During this phase players may begin building ships and knights and move already built ships and knights. No attack actions are allowed.</li>
				<li><b>Phase 3 - Attack:</b> During this phase attack actions are allowed, and a simultaneous turn order mechanic is introduced:
				<p><b>Simultaneous turn order mechanic:</b></p>
					<ul>
						<li>At the beginning of the round one player rolls for resource production and everyone gathers their resources as per usual. However this will be the only resource production for the round.</li>	
						<li>After resource production, every player simultaneously and secretly must write down on paper everything they intend to do on their turn. This includes all building, moving and attacking. Notation is up to each player so long as it is legible and not ambiguous. Example:
						<ul>
							<li>Build ship @ brick port and attack white ship</li>
							<li>Build knight @ 5 ore and attack blue city (defending knight)</li>
							<li>Move 9 wheat knight to 12 wood and attack blue city</li>
							<li>10 gold knight attacks white city</li>
							<li>Move 6 wood ship to wheat port and attack red settlement</li>
							<li>5 ore ship attacks blue settlement (defending ship)</li>
						</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Once all players have completed writing down all their moves, begin resolution phase</li>
						<li><b>Resolution:</b> Turns are resolved sequentially beginning with the first player, however, if any player turn action (to include building, buying dev cards, moving and attacking) results in an "action conflict" with any other players, then that conflict must be immediately resolved by all players involved.</li>
						<li><b>Conflict identification:</b> A turn conflict occurs simply when two or more players have recorded intended turn actions that have overlapping effects and or dependencies. An example will help illustrate:
						<p>Conflict id example 1</p>
						<p>It is important that all players pay attention during resolution, and correctly identify conflicts at the time of first resolution. If a conflict is later identified because a player failed to recognize it during first resolution, then they lose the opportunity for conflict resolution and must execute their turn action based on the current state of the board.</p>
						<li><b>Conflict resolution:</b> A conflict is resolved by first determining turn order. This is done simply with a dice roll. If two players are involved, they each roll one die and the higher die wins. Ties are re-rolled. The winner of the roll may choose which player executes their intended turn action first. The turn action is immediately executed, and then the other player executes their intended action and the conflict is resolved. All players involved cross off those actions in their ledgers and turn resolutions continue.
						<p>Conflict resolution examples...todo</p>
						</li>
						<li>If a conflict resolution renders any of a players recorded intented moves no longer eligible, then that player may immediately change only the affected moves to eligible moves.
						<p>example...todo</p>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In a 3-4 player game, each phase lasts three rounds of turns. In a 5-6 player game each phase lasts 2 rounds of turns. Implement a counter to keep track. At the end of the last round, the player with the most victory points wins. If a tie exists declare more than one winner.</p>
