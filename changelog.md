playtest changes made v1.2

Add clarification that gold hexes replace wheat, sheep and wood (4 player game) resulting in a balanced 3 hexes per resource plus 1 desert board configuration.

Add clarification that Monopoly card can not be used for gold.

Add starting resource production changes. First placement is settlement, second city. Then draw 1 resource for each hex adjacent to settlement and 2 resources for each hex adjacent to city.

Add change to dragon count. The sum of the dots of all gold he's resource production numbers determines how many gold must be produced to trigger a dragon attack.

Remove Kraken.

Change to allow building 2 ships or 2 knights or 1 ship and 1 knight per turn.

Remove resource production for knights and ships.

Allow two actions per knight and ship with restrictions:
  Building a knight or ship is considered an action, so a player may build and move, or build and attack (if in attack phase) but may not build, move, and attack with the same piece in the same turn.
  Each action must be unique. A player may not move the same knight twice or attack with the same knight twice. 

Add clarification that ship and knight actions can occur at any point in a player's turn. For example, at the beginning of a player's turn, he may move his ship to a nearby port, and then use that port before building.

Add clarification that during attack phase, a newly built knight or ship may defend on the same turn, and defending does not count as an action.

Add clarification that adjacent ships can not defend coastal settlements from knight attacks. Likewise vice versa.

Add clarification that knights and ships occupy the center of hexes, not corners like settlements do.

Add 5-6 player phases last only two rounds.

Attack phase resource production is only one roll per round, and for the final round there is no resource roll.


Add simultaneous turn rules.
Add clarification that if an attack conflict resolution renders any of a players recorded intented moves no longer eligible, then that player may immediately change only the affected moves to eligible moves.  

Add clarification that at the end of last round, if a tie exists, declare more than one winner.
